20065175	Ultrasound morphology criteria predict metastatic disease of the sentinel nodes in patients with melanoma.	PURPOSE We have shown that ultrasound (US) -guided fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) can accurately identify the sentinel node (SN). Moreover, US-guided FNAC before the surgical SN procedure could identify up to 65% of all SN metastases. Herein we analyzed in detail the different US morphologic patterns of SN metastases. PATIENTS AND METHODS From July 2001 to December 2007, a total of 650 patients with melanoma scheduled for sentinel lymph node dissection were examined. We present the first 400 with sufficient follow-up (mean 40, median 39 months). Several morphologic characteristics were scored. In case of suspicious/clearly malignant US patterns a FNAC was performed. The final histology was considered the gold standard. Results Median Breslow was 1.8 mm. The sensitivity and positive predictive value of the most important factors were: peripheral perfusion (PP) present (77% and 52%, respectively), loss of central echoes (LCE; 60% and 65% respectively), and balloon shape (BS; 30% and 96% respectively). Together these factors have a sensitivity of 82% and PPV of 52% (P < .001). PP identified more patients with lower volume disease. PP and combined BS and LCE were independent prognostic factors for survival (hazard ratio, 2.19; P < .015; and hazard ratio, 5.50; P < .001, respectively). CONCLUSION Preoperative US and FNAC can identify 65% of SN metastases and thus reduce the need for surgical SN procedures. Peripheral perfusion is an early sign of involvement and of crucial importance to achieve a high identification rate. Balloon shape and loss of central echoes are late signs of metastases. We recommend US evaluation to identify those patients, who can directly proceed to a complete lymph node dissection after a positive US-guided FNAC of the SN.	1b
25204572	Clinical practice guidelines for identification, screening and follow-up of individuals at high risk of primary cutaneous melanoma: a systematic review.	Understanding how individuals at high-risk of primary cutaneous melanoma are best identified, screened and followed up will help optimize melanoma prevention strategies and clinical management. We conducted a systematic review of international clinical practice guidelines and documented the quality of supporting evidence for recommendations for clinical management of individuals at high risk of melanoma. Guidelines published between January 2000 and July 2014 were identified from a systematic search of Medline, Embase and four guideline databases; 34 guidelines from 20 countries were included. High-risk characteristics that were consistently reported included many melanocytic naevi, dysplastic naevi, family history, large congenital naevi, and Fitzpatrick Type I and II skin types. Most guidelines identify risk factors and recommend that individuals at high risk of cutaneous melanoma be monitored, but only half of the guidelines provide recommendations for screening based on level of risk. There is disagreement in screening and follow-up recommendations for those with an increased risk of future melanoma. High-level evidence supports long-term screening of individuals at high risk and monitoring using dermoscopy. Evidence is low for defining screening intervals and duration of follow-up, and for skin self-examination, although education about skin self-examination is widely encouraged. Clinical practice guidelines would benefit from a dedicated section for identification, screening and follow-up of individuals at high risk of melanoma. Guidelines could be improved with clear definitions of multiple naevi, family history and frequency of follow-up. Research examining the benefits and costs of alternative management strategies for groups at high risk will enhance the quality of recommendations.	2a
30113073	Risk of endometrial cancer and endometrial hyperplasia with atypia in asymptomatic postmenopausal women with endometrial thickness >/=11 mm: A systematic review and meta-analysis.	"PURPOSE: To evaluate the risk of endometrial cancer and/or endometrial hyperplasia with atypia in asymptomatic postmenopausal women with endometrial thickness >/= 11 mm. METHODS: Systematic review of literature using database search (PubMed and Web of Science) of articles published between January 1990 and December 2016 evaluating the correlation between endometrial thickness as measured by transvaginal ultrasound (double layer) and histopathological findings in asymptomatic postmenopausal women, using the following terms: ""endometrial thickness,"" ""postmenopausal,"" ""postmenopause,"" and ""asymptomatic."" Inclusion criteria were prospective or retrospective studies of more than 150 cases that provided information on endometrial thickness and its correlation with histopathological data. Studies that included patients with hormone replacement therapy, tamoxifen, or aromatase inhibitors were excluded. The overall relative risk (RR) for EC/EHA was calculated, stratifying the patients into two groups according to endometrial thickness (<11 mm and >/=11 mm). Heterogeneity was assessed by calculating I(2) . RESULTS: The search identified 289 studies. After exclusions, nine articles that met all the inclusion criteria were included, comprising data from 4751 women. The prevalence of endometrial cancer and/or endometrial hyperplasia with atypia was 2.4%. The relative risk of endometrial cancer and/or endometrial hyperplasia with atypia in the >/=11 mm group was 2.59 (95% CI: 1.66-4.05). High heterogeneity was observed between studies (I(2) : 57.3%, P = .016). CONCLUSIONS: Overall the risk for EC/EHA was 2.6 times greater in women with ET >/=11 mm vs women with ET 5-10 mm, although there was significant heterogeneity in estimates across studies."	2a
21561347	FOLFIRINOX versus gemcitabine for metastatic pancreatic cancer.	BACKGROUND: Data are lacking on the efficacy and safety of a combination chemotherapy regimen consisting of oxaliplatin, irinotecan, fluorouracil, and leucovorin (FOLFIRINOX) as compared with gemcitabine as first-line therapy in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer. METHODS: We randomly assigned 342 patients with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status score of 0 or 1 (on a scale of 0 to 5, with higher scores indicating a greater severity of illness) to receive FOLFIRINOX (oxaliplatin, 85 mg per square meter of body-surface area; irinotecan, 180 mg per square meter; leucovorin, 400 mg per square meter; and fluorouracil, 400 mg per square meter given as a bolus followed by 2400 mg per square meter given as a 46-hour continuous infusion, every 2 weeks) or gemcitabine at a dose of 1000 mg per square meter weekly for 7 of 8 weeks and then weekly for 3 of 4 weeks. Six months of chemotherapy were recommended in both groups in patients who had a response. The primary end point was overall survival. RESULTS: The median overall survival was 11.1 months in the FOLFIRINOX group as compared with 6.8 months in the gemcitabine group (hazard ratio for death, 0.57; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.45 to 0.73; P<0.001). Median progression-free survival was 6.4 months in the FOLFIRINOX group and 3.3 months in the gemcitabine group (hazard ratio for disease progression, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.37 to 0.59; P<0.001). The objective response rate was 31.6% in the FOLFIRINOX group versus 9.4% in the gemcitabine group (P<0.001). More adverse events were noted in the FOLFIRINOX group; 5.4% of patients in this group had febrile neutropenia. At 6 months, 31% of the patients in the FOLFIRINOX group had a definitive degradation of the quality of life versus 66% in the gemcitabine group (hazard ratio, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.30 to 0.70; P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: As compared with gemcitabine, FOLFIRINOX was associated with a survival advantage and had increased toxicity. FOLFIRINOX is an option for the treatment of patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer and good performance status.

31094582	Effects of lymphadenectomy among women with stage IA endometrial cancer: a SEER database analysis.	Aim: To determine whether lymphadenectomy is associated with increased survival of women with stage IA endometrial cancer. Methods: Patients diagnosed with endometrial cancer from 2004 to 2013 and whose clinicopathologic data were recorded in the SEER database were examined. Propensity matching paired subjects with similar background variables. Before and after matching, Kaplan-Meier curves were drawn for comparison. Results: In 11,603 patients, cardiovascular disease and diabetes were the most common causes of death. Before matching, lymphadenectomy significantly improved the overall survival of stage IA/grade 3-4 patients (p = 0.013), but after matching, lymphadenectomy did not prolong survival for any grade. Sentinel lymph nodes biopsy can reduce the number of resected lymph nodes (p = 8.387e-10 in Wilcox test) but can't prolong survival. Conclusion: After matching, no significant difference in survival between lymphadenectomy and nonlymphadenectomy was observed for stage IA patients, sentinel lymph nodes group had fewer lymph node removed, but didn't affect survival.	4
22105823	Use of a decision aid to help caregivers discuss terminal disease status with a family member with cancer: a randomized controlled trial.	PURPOSE: We tested whether a decision aid explaining how to discuss the approach of death with a family member with cancer would help family caregivers decide to discuss a terminal prognosis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We randomly assigned caregivers of terminally ill patients with cancer to a group that received a video and a companion workbook that showed either how they can discuss the prognosis with their patient (experimental arm) or how cancer pain can be controlled (control arm). At baseline and 1 month, we evaluated the decision to discuss terminal prognosis as the primary outcome. At 0, 1, 3, and 6 months, we assessed the caregivers' decisional conflict and satisfaction as secondary outcomes using a Decision Conflict Scale (DCS). RESULTS: We found no difference in changes in the decision to discuss terminal prognosis between the two groups. Conflict (P = .003), uncertainty (P = .019), and value clarity (P = .007) subscale scores and total DCS score (P = .008) improved from baseline to 1 month significantly more in the experimental arm than in the control arm. Over 6 months, the significant between-group differences continued for the conflict (P = .031), uncertainty (P = .014), and value clarity (P = .039) subscale scores and total DCS score (P = .040). CONCLUSION: Decision aids can help caregivers, with the aid of trained professionals, to communicate with patients about their terminal illness.	1b
18791364	Left-sided pancreatectomy: a multicenter comparison of laparoscopic and open approaches.	OBJECTIVES: To compare perioperative outcomes of laparoscopic left-sided pancreatectomy (LLP) with traditional open left-sided pancreatectomy (OLP) in a multicenter experience. SUMMARY AND BACKGROUND DATA: LLP is being performed more commonly with limited data comparing results with outcomes from OLP. METHODS: Data from 8 centers were combined for all cases performed between 2002-2006. OLP and LLP cohorts were matched by age, American Society of Anesthesiologists, resected pancreas length, tumor size, and diagnosis. Multivariate analysis was performed using binary logistic regression. RESULTS: Six hundred sixty-seven LPs were performed, with 159 (24%) attempted laparoscopically. Indications were solid lesion in 307 (46%), cystic in 295 (44%), and pancreatitis in 65 (10%) cases. Positive margins occurred in 51 (8%) cases, 335 (50%) had complications, and significant leaks occurred in 108 (16%). Conversion to OLP occurred in 20 (13%) of the LLPs. In the matched comparison, 200 OLPs were compared with 142 LLPs. There were no differences in positive margin rates (8% vs. 7%, P = 0.8), operative times (216 vs. 230 minutes, P = 0.3), or leak rates (18% vs. 11%, P = 0.1). LLP patients had lower average blood loss (357 vs. 588 mL, P < 0.01), fewer complications (40% vs. 57%, P < 0.01), and shorter hospital stays (5.9 vs. 9.0 days, P < 0.01). By MVA, LLP was an independent factor for shorter hospital stay (P < 0.01, odds ratio 0.33, 95% confidence interval 0.19-0.56). CONCLUSIONS: In selected patients, LLP is associated with less morbidity and shorter LOS than OLP. Pancreatic fistula rates are similar for OLP and LLP. LLP is appropriate for selected patients with left-sided pancreatic pathology.	4
17021903	Preliminary experience with transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) in liver metastases of uveal malignant melanoma: local tumor control and survival.	PURPOSE: To evaluate results in the palliative treatment of patients with liver metastases of uveal malignant melanoma using transarterial chemoembolization (TACE). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Superselective TACE was repeatedly performed in 12 patients with liver metastases of uveal malignant melanoma. Six patients presented with solitary liver metastases (6-12 cm in size) and six patients with oligonodular metastases (n < or = 6). The embolization suspension consisted of a maximum of 10 mg/m(2) Mitomycin C, 10 ml Lipiodol, and an injection of 200-450 mg resorbable microspheres for vascular occlusion. In the follow-up, magnetic resonance imaging was performed in 3-month intervals. RESULTS: The TACE procedure was well tolerated in all patients without any relevant side effects. Three patients responded to TACE with a size reduction of more than 50% (partial response), five patients with stable disease, and four patients with progressive disease with an increase in volume of more than 25%. Mean survival following primary tumor treatment was 32.9 months, and after first embolization 19.5 months. Lower survival rates were recorded for the progressive group (16.5 months). CONCLUSION: Repeated TACE offers a palliative treatment option in patients with oligonodular liver metastases of uveal malignant melanoma.	4
18560003	Prostate cancer-specific survival following salvage radiotherapy vs observation in men with biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy.	CONTEXT: Biochemical disease recurrence after radical prostatectomy often prompts salvage radiotherapy, but no studies to date have had sufficient numbers of patients or follow-up to determine whether radiotherapy improves survival, and if so, the subgroup of men most likely to benefit. OBJECTIVES: To quantify the relative improvement in prostate cancer-specific survival of salvage radiotherapy vs no therapy after biochemical recurrence following prostatectomy, and to identify subgroups for whom salvage treatment is most beneficial. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Retrospective analysis of a cohort of 635 US men undergoing prostatectomy from 1982-2004, followed up through December 28, 2007, who experienced biochemical and/or local recurrence and received no salvage treatment (n = 397), salvage radiotherapy alone (n = 160), or salvage radiotherapy combined with hormonal therapy (n = 78). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Prostate cancer-specific survival defined from time of recurrence until death from disease. RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 6 years after recurrence and 9 years after prostatectomy, 116 men (18%) died from prostate cancer, including 89 (22%) who received no salvage treatment, 18 (11%) who received salvage radiotherapy alone, and 9 (12%) who received salvage radiotherapy and hormonal therapy. Salvage radiotherapy alone was associated with a significant 3-fold increase in prostate cancer-specific survival relative to those who received no salvage treatment (hazard ratio [HR], 0.32 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.19-0.54]; P<.001). Addition of hormonal therapy to salvage radiotherapy was not associated with any additional increase in prostate cancer-specific survival (HR, 0.34 [95% CI, 0.17-0.69]; P = .003). The increase in prostate cancer-specific survival associated with salvage radiotherapy was limited to men with a prostate-specific antigen doubling time of less than 6 months and remained after adjustment for pathological stage and other established prognostic factors. Salvage radiotherapy initiated more than 2 years after recurrence provided no significant increase in prostate cancer-specific survival. Men whose prostate-specific antigen level never became undetectable after salvage radiotherapy did not experience a significant increase in prostate cancer-specific survival. Salvage radiotherapy also was associated with a significant increase in overall survival. CONCLUSIONS: Salvage radiotherapy administered within 2 years of biochemical recurrence was associated with a significant increase in prostate cancer-specific survival among men with a prostate-specific antigen doubling time of less than 6 months, independent of other prognostic features such as pathological stage or Gleason score. These preliminary findings should be validated in other settings, and ultimately, in a randomized controlled trial.	2a
20133068	Multicenter, phase 3 trial comparing selenium supplementation with observation in gynecologic radiation oncology.	PURPOSE: We assessed whether adjuvant supplementation with selenium improves the selenium status and reduces side effects of patients treated by radiotherapy (RT) for cervical and uterine cancer. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Whole-blood selenium concentrations were measured in patients with cervical cancer (n = 11) and uterine cancer (n = 70) after surgical treatment, during RT, at the end of RT, and 6 weeks after RT. Patients with initial selenium concentrations of less than 84mug/L were randomized before RT either to receive 500 mug of selenium (in the form of sodium selenite [selenase, biosyn Arzneimittel GmbH, Fellbach, Germany]) by mouth on the days of RT and 300 mug of selenium on the days without RT or to receive no supplement during RT. The primary endpoint of this multicenter Phase 3 study was to assess the efficiency of selenium supplementation during RT; the secondary endpoint was to decrease radiation-induced diarrhea and other RT-dependent side effects. RESULTS: A total of 81 patients were randomized. We enrolled 39 in the selenium group (SG) and 42 in the control group (CG). Selenium levels did not differ between the SG and CG upon study initiation but were significantly higher in the SG at the end of RT. The actuarial incidence of diarrhea of Grade 2 or higher according to Common Toxicity Criteria (version 2) in the SG was 20.5% compared with 44.5% in the CG (p = 0.04). Other blood parameters, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, and self-reported quality of life were not different between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: Selenium supplementation during RT is effective in improving blood selenium status in selenium-deficient cervical and uterine cancer patients and reduces the number of episodes and severity of RT-induced diarrhea.	1b
23977264	Pyridoxine for prevention of hand-foot syndrome caused by chemotherapy: a systematic review.	BACKGROUND: Hand-foot syndrome (HFS) is a relatively frequent dermatologic toxic reaction to certain anti-cancer chemotherapies. The syndrome can evolve into a distressing condition that limits function and affects quality of life. Pyridoxine (vitamin B6) has been used empirically for the prevention of HFS caused by anti-cancer therapy. However, evidence of its efficacy remains controversial. METHODOLOGY//PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Systematic literature searches were conducted on the Cochrane Library, PUBMED, EMBASE, LILACS, CBM, CNKI, VIP, WANFANG and the U.S. ClinicalTrials.gov website. We included all related randomized controlled trials (RCTs) irrespective of language. Reviewers from different professions independently assessed all potential studies and extracted data. Subgroup analysis was planned according to dose of pyridoxine. 5 RCTs involving 607 patients were contributed to the meta-analysis. No significant differences were found between patients receiving pyridoxine and placebo for prevention of incidence of HFS and grade 2 or worse HFS (relative risk (RR) 0.96, 95%confidence interval (CI) 0.86-1.06; RR0.95, 95%CI 0.73-1.24, respectively). Similarly, no significant improvement in quality of life was detected among patients. However, significant difference was found for prevention of grade 2 or worse HFS with pyridoxine 400 mg daily compared to 200 mg (RR0.55, 95%CI 0.33-0.92). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: There is inadequate evidence to make any recommendation about using pyridoxine for prevention of HFS caused by chemotherapy. However, pyridoxine 400 mg may have some efficacy. Further studies of large sample sizes are needed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of pyridoxine, especially at high dose, in comparison with placebo.	1a
26096561	Sentinel lymph node biopsy is prognostic but not therapeutic for thick melanoma.	BACKGROUND: Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SNB) as a staging and therapeutic procedure in melanomas 1-4 mm in thickness has been investigated extensively, however, the clinical value of SNB in thick melanomas is poorly understood. METHODS: Patients undergoing operation for clinically node-negative melanoma >4 mm in depth between 2003 and 2010 were identified in the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results registry. Two groups were constructed: one with a wide excision with SNB and the other with wide excision alone. RESULTS: A total of 4,571 patients with clinically node-negative, thick melanoma were identified. The median age was 71 years, 96.9% were white, and 64.3% were male. SNB was performed in 2,746 (60.1%) and was positive in 32.2%. Univariate analysis demonstrated SNB was associated with younger age (64 vs 75 years; P < .001) and extremity primaries (P < .0001). On logistic regression, advanced age (P < .001), female sex (P = .009), and location in the head and neck region (P < .001) were associated with observation. On log-rank analysis, improved 5-year disease-specific survival (DSS) was associated with SNB (65 vs 62%; P = .008), location in the extremity versus head and neck or trunk (67 vs 61.5 and 60.3%; P = .004), female sex (69 vs 61%; P < .001), and no ulceration (74 vs 54%; P < .001). On Cox regression analysis, advanced age (P < .001), male sex (P = .01), trunk location (P = .0001), and ulceration (P < .001) continued to be associated with DSS. SNB was not associated with survival (P = .20). SNB status was a robust predictor of survival; a negative SNB had a 5-year DSS of 75.3 versus 44.1% (P < .0001), with a positive node. CONCLUSION: For patients with clinically node-negative, thick melanoma, SNB is a staging but not therapeutic procedure.	3a
19906525	A randomised, controlled trial of the psychological effects of reflexology in early breast cancer.	PURPOSE: To conduct a pragmatic randomised controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the effects of reflexology on quality of life (QofL) in women with early breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred and eighty-three women were randomised 6 weeks post-breast surgery to self-initiated support (SIS) (comparator intervention), SIS plus reflexology, or SIS plus scalp massage (control for physical and social contact). Reflexology and massage comprised eight sessions at weekly intervals. The primary end-point was 18 weeks post surgery; the primary outcome measure was the Trial Outcome Index (TOI) of the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT-B) - breast cancer version. The secondary end-point was 24 weeks post surgery. Secondary outcome measures were the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the Mood Rating Scale (MRS). RESULTS: At primary end-point, massage, but not reflexology, was significantly better than SIS on the TOI. Reflexology and massage were both better than SIS for MRS relaxation. Massage was better than reflexology and SIS for MRS easygoingness. At secondary end-point, reflexology, but not massage, was better than SIS on the TOI and MRS relaxation. There were no significant differences between reflexology or massage. There were no significant between group differences in HADS anxiety and depression. Self-reported use of out of study complementary therapies indicated that this was unlikely to have a significant effect on findings. CONCLUSIONS: When compared to SIS, reflexology and massage have statistically significant, and, for reflexology, clinically worthwhile, effects on QofL following surgery for early breast carcinoma.	1b
16942867	Clinical outcomes of expiratory muscle training in severe COPD patients.	UNLABELLED: The most common symptoms in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients are breathlessness and exercise limitation. Although both general and inspiratory muscle training have shown clinical benefits, the effects of specific expiratory muscle training remain controversial. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of expiratory training on lung function, exercise tolerance, symptoms and health-related quality of life in severe COPD patients. METHODS: Sixteen patients (FEV(1), 28+/-8% pred.) were randomised to either expiratory muscle or sham training groups, both completing a 5-week programme (30 min sessions breathing through an expiratory threshold valve 3 times per week) (50% of their maximal expiratory pressure (MEP) vs. placebo, respectively). Lung function, exercise capacity (bicycle ergometry and walking test), and clinical outcomes (dyspnoea and quality of life (St. George Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ)) were evaluated both at baseline and following the training period. RESULTS: Although lung function remained roughly unchanged after training, exercise capacity, symptoms and quality of life significantly improved. The improvement in both walking distance and the SGRQ score significantly correlated with changes in MEP. CONCLUSION: Our results confirm that a short outpatient programme of expiratory training can improve symptoms and quality of life in severe COPD patients. These effects could be partially explained by changes in expiratory muscle strength.	1a
18784438	CA 19-9 response as an early indicator of the effectiveness of gemcitabine in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer.	BACKGROUND: The CA 19-9 decline 8 weeks after gemcitabine administration has been shown to be a useful prognosticator of survival in patients with pancreatic cancer. We assessed the prognostic value of changes in CA 19-9 levels 4 weeks after treatment initiation on overall survival (OS) and time to progression (TTP). METHODS: We evaluated 72 patients who received gemcitabine for advanced pancreatic cancer. The serum CA 19-9 level was measured routinely at baseline (CA 19-9_Pre) and after the first (4 weeks; CA 19-9_A1) and second (8 weeks; CA 19-9_A2) courses. CA 19-9 responses were categorized into quartiles using the proportional change in CA 19-9. RESULTS: The rates of decrease in CA 19-9_A1 and CA 19-9_A2 were strongly correlated with each other (r = 0.8981, p < 0.0001). Multivariate analysis revealed that an early CA 19-9 response was prognostic of OS and TTP in addition to CA 19-9_Pre and performance status. Compared with the first quartile of an early CA 19-9 response, hazard ratios for the second, third and fourth quartiles were 0.91 (95% confidence interval, CI, 0.59-1.34), 0.71 (95% CI, 0.45-1.08), and 0.63 (95% CI, 0.41-0.94) for TTP, respectively (p for trend = 0.002), and 0.98 (95% CI, 0.61-1.49), 0.68 (95% CI, 0.40-1.08) and 0.79 (95% CI, 0.50-1.21) for OS (p for trend = 0.036). CONCLUSION: CA 19-9 response after the first course of gemcitabine was a prognosticator of OS and TTP in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer.	2b
25173586	Early integration of palliative care facilitates the discontinuation of anticancer treatment in women with advanced breast or gynecologic cancers.	OBJECTIVES: To evaluate some health indicators in women with advanced breast or gynecological cancers (ABGCs) after discontinuation of active cancer treatment in function of the model of care received. METHODS: This prospective study included patients who were discontinuing anticancer treatment to be followed up only with palliative care (PC). Patients who had been evaluated at least once in PC were categorized as the integrated care model (ICM); those who had not been consulted by the PC team before, as the traditional care model (TCM). Data were analyzed using chi-square, Mann-Whitney, Kaplan-Meier, and Cox regression model. RESULTS: Among the 87 patients included in the study, 37 (42.5%) had been previously evaluated by the PC team (ICM). Patients who were followed up under an ICM exhibited better QoL (global health, p=0.02; emotional functioning, p=0.03; social functioning, p=0.01; insomnia, p=0.02) and less depression (p=0.01). The communication process had no issues in 73% of cases from the ICM group compared with 42% of cases from the TCM group (p=0.004). Patients who were not previously evaluated in PC received more chemotherapy in the last 6weeks of life compared to those who had already been evaluated (40% versus 5.9%, p=0.001). Early evaluation in PC was one of the independent prognostic factors of overall survival. CONCLUSION: When followed up concurrently by a PC and clinical oncology team, patients reported better QoL and less depression, received less chemotherapy within the last 6weeks of life and survived longer than those followed up under a TCM.	1b
15700039	Sentinel node status in melanoma patients is not predictive for overall survival upon multivariate analysis.	Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) has become a widely accepted standard procedure in the staging of patients with cutaneous melanoma and absence of clinical lymph node metastases, although there is no final proof that SLNB influences overall survival in these patients. This study investigated the accuracy of SLNB and the clinical outcome of patients after a mean follow-up of 22 months. Between 1998 and 2003, SLNB was performed in 309 consecutive patients. Patients with one or more positive sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) were subjected to selective lymphadenectomy (SL). Survival analyses were performed using the Kaplan-Meier approach. A Cox proportional-hazard analysis was used for univariate and multivariate analysis to explore the effect of variables on survival. Sentinel lymph nodes were identified in 299 of 309 patients (success rate: 96.8%). Of these, 69 (23%) had a positive SLN. The false-negative rate was 9.2%. Recurrence of disease to the regional lymph node basin (3.0%) and to the locoregional skin (2.6%) was rare in SLN-negative patients in contrast to SLN-positive patients (7.2 and 17.4%, respectively). The 3-year overall survival was 93 and 83% for SLN-negative and SLN-positive patients, respectively. Upon multivariate analysis, SLN status (P<0.001), Breslow thickness (P<0.02) and ulceration (P<0.026) were all found to be independent prognostic factors with respect to disease-free survival, whereas Breslow thickness proved to be the only significant factor with respect to overall survival.	2b
27644633	Efficacy of Ginger in Control of Chemotherapy Induced Nausea and Vomiting in Breast Cancer Patients Receiving Doxorubicin-Based Chemotherapy.	Nausea and vomiting are among the most serious side effects of chemotherapy, in some cases leading to treatment interruption or chemotherapy dose reduction. Ginger has long been known as an antiemetic drug, used for conditions such as motion sickness, nausea-vomiting in pregnancy, and post-operation side effects. One hundred and fifty female patients with breast cancer entered this prospective study and were randomized to receive ginger (500 mg ginger powder, twice a day for 3 days) or placebo. One hundred and nineteen patients completed the study: 57 of them received ginger and 62 received ginger for the frst 3 chemotherapy cycles. Mean age in all patients was 48.6 (25-79) years. After 1st chemotherapy, mean nausea in the ginger and control arms were 1.36 (+/-1.31) and 1.46 (+/-1.28) with no statistically significant difference. After the 2nd chemotherapy session, nausea score was slightly more in the ginger group (1.36 versus 1.32). After 3rd chemotherapy, mean nausea severity in control group was less than ginger group [1.37 (+/-1.14), versus 1.42 (+/-1.30)]. Considering all patients, nausea was slightly more severe in ginger arm. In ginger arm mean nausea score was 1.42 (+/-0.96) and in control arm it was 1.40 (+/-0.92). Mean vomiting scores after chemotherapy in ginger arm were 0.719 (+/-1.03), 0.68 (+/-1.00) and 0.77 (+/-1.18). In control arm, mean vomiting was 0.983 (+/-1.23), 1.03 (+/-1.22) and 1.15 (+/-1.27). In all sessions, ginger decreased vomiting severity from 1.4 (+/-1.04) to 0.71 (+/-0.86). None of the differences were significant. In those patients who received the AC regimen, vomiting was less severe (0.64+/-0.87) compared to those who received placebo (1.13+/-1.12), which was statistically significant (p-value <0.05). Further and larger studies are needed to draw conclusions.	2b
16686707	Incidence of positive pelvic lymph nodes in patients with prostate cancer, a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level of < or =10 ng/mL and biopsy Gleason score of < or =6, and their influence on PSA progression-free survival after radical prostatectomy.	OBJECTIVE: To investigate how many men with low-risk prostate cancer had positive lymph nodes detected by radio-guided surgery and whether they had a higher biochemical relapse rate after radical prostatectomy, because in such patients most urologists dispense with operative lymph node staging, as nomograms indicate only a low percentage of lymph node metastases. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study included 474 men with a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level of < or = 10 ng/mL, biopsy Gleason score of < or = 6 and positive biopsies in one (group 1, 315 men) or both lobes (group 2, 159 men); follow-up data were available in 357 men. Men with adjuvant radiation or hormone therapy before the occurrence of biochemical relapse were excluded. RESULTS: Positive lymph nodes were detected in 17 men in group 1, and in 18 in group 2. In more than half of the patients (19/35) these nodes were found outside the region of standard lymphadenectomy. Men with node-positive disease had a higher biochemical relapse rate (P < 0.001). When the tumour was organ-confined and well differentiated in node-positive disease (Gleason score < or = 6) the biochemical relapse rate was lower than in men with higher tumour stage and grade. CONCLUSIONS: When dissecting pelvic lymph nodes, extended or sentinel lymphadenectomy should be preferred. Removing the diseased nodes could improve the PSA progression-free survival, especially in well differentiated organ-confined disease.	2a
28920142	Acupuncture for reduction of symptom burden in multiple myeloma patients undergoing autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation: a randomized sham-controlled trial.	PURPOSE: Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT) is potentially curative for a number of hematologic malignancies, but is associated with high symptom burden. We conducted a randomized sham-controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate efficacy and safety of acupuncture as an integrative treatment for managing common symptoms during HCT. METHODS: Adult patients with multiple myeloma undergoing high-dose melphalan followed by autologous HCT (AHCT) were randomized to receive either true or sham acupuncture once daily for 5 days starting the day after chemotherapy. Patients and clinical evaluators, but not acupuncturists, were blinded to group assignment. Symptom burden, the primary outcome was assessed with the MD Anderson Symptom Inventory (MDASI) at baseline, during transplantation, and at 15 and 30 days post transplantation. RESULTS: Among 60 participants, true acupuncture produced nonsignificant reductions in overall MDASI core symptom scores and symptom interference scores during transplantation (P = .4 and .3, respectively), at 15 days (P = .10 and .3), and at 30 days posttransplantation (P = .2 and .4) relative to sham. However, true acupuncture was significantly more efficacious in reducing nausea, lack of appetite, and drowsiness at 15 days (P = .042, .025, and .010, respectively). Patients receiving sham acupuncture were more likely to increase pain medication use posttransplantation (odds ratio 5.31, P = .017). CONCLUSIONS: Acupuncture was well tolerated with few attributable adverse events. True acupuncture may prevent escalation of symptoms including nausea, lack of appetite, and drowsiness experienced by patients undergoing AHCT, and reduce the use of pain medications. These findings need to be confirmed in a future definitive study. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT01811862.	2b
27480103	Cobimetinib combined with vemurafenib in advanced BRAF(V600)-mutant melanoma (coBRIM): updated efficacy results from a randomised, double-blind, phase 3 trial.	BACKGROUND: The combination of cobimetinib with vemurafenib improves progression-free survival compared with placebo and vemurafenib in previously untreated patients with BRAF(V600)-mutant advanced melanoma, as previously reported in the coBRIM study. In this Article, we report updated efficacy results, including overall survival and safety after longer follow-up, and selected biomarker correlative studies. METHODS: In this double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, multicentre study, adult patients (aged >/=18 years) with histologically confirmed BRAF(V600) mutation-positive unresectable stage IIIC or stage IV melanoma were randomly assigned (1:1) using an interactive response system to receive cobimetinib (60 mg once daily for 21 days followed by a 7-day rest period in each 28-day cycle) or placebo, in combination with oral vemurafenib (960 mg twice daily). Progression-free and overall survival were primary and secondary endpoints, respectively; all analyses were done on the intention-to-treat population. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01689519, and is ongoing but no longer recruiting participants. FINDINGS: Between Jan 8, 2013, and Jan 31, 2014, 495 eligible adult patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to the cobimetinib plus vemurafenib group (n=247) or placebo plus vemurafenib group (n=248). At a median follow-up of 14.2 months (IQR 8.5-17.3), the updated investigator-assessed median progression-free survival was 12.3 months (95% CI 9.5-13.4) for cobimetinib and vemurafenib versus 7.2 months (5.6-7.5) for placebo and vemurafenib (HR 0.58 [95% CI 0.46-0.72], p<0.0001). The final analysis for overall survival occurred when 255 (52%) patients had died (Aug 28, 2015). Median overall survival was 22.3 months (95% CI 20.3-not estimable) for cobimetinib and vemurafenib versus 17.4 months (95% CI 15.0-19.8) for placebo and vemurafenib (HR 0.70, 95% CI 0.55-0.90; p=0.005). The safety profile for cobimetinib and vemurafenib was tolerable and manageable, and no new safety signals were observed with longer follow-up. The most common grade 3-4 adverse events occurring at a higher frequency in patients in the cobimetinib and vemurafenib group compared with the vemurafenib group were gamma-glutamyl transferase increase (36 [15%] in the cobimetinib and vemurafenib group vs 25 [10%] in the placebo and vemurafenib group), blood creatine phosphokinase increase (30 [12%] vs one [<1%]), and alanine transaminase increase (28 [11%] vs 15 [6%]). Serious adverse events occurred in 92 patients (37%) in the cobimetinib and vemurafenib group and 69 patients (28%) in the vemurafenib group. Pyrexia (six patients [2%]) and dehydration (five patients [2%]) were the most common serious adverse events reported in the cobimetinib and vemurafenib group. A total of 259 patients have died: 117 (47%) in the cobimetinib and vemurafenib group and 142 (58%) in the vemurafenib group. The primary cause of death was disease progression in most patients: 109 (93%) of 117 in the cobimetinib and vemurafenib group and 133 (94%) of 142 in the vemurafenib group. INTERPRETATION: These data confirm the clinical benefit of cobimetinib combined with vemurafenib and support the use of the combination as a standard first-line approach to improve survival in patients with advanced BRAF(V600)-mutant melanoma.

21154350	Hyperfractionated or accelerated radiotherapy for head and neck cancer.	BACKGROUND: Several trials have studied the role of altered fractionation radiotherapy in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, but the effect of such treatment on survival is not clear. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis was to assess whether this type of radiotherapy could improve survival. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register; CENTRAL (2010, Issue 3); PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; BIOSIS Previews; Cambridge Scientific Abstracts; ISRCTN and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the most recent search was 8 August 2010. SELECTION CRITERIA: We identified randomised trials comparing conventional radiotherapy with hyperfractionated or accelerated radiotherapy, or both, in patients with non-metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinomas and grouped trials into three pre-specified treatment categories: hyperfractionated, accelerated and accelerated with total dose reduction. Trials were eligible if they began recruitment after 1969 and ended before 1998. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We obtained updated individual patient data. Overall survival was the main outcome measure. The secondary outcome measures were local or regional control rates (or both), distant control rates and cause-specific mortality. MAIN RESULTS: We included 15 trials with 6515 patients. The median follow up was six years. Tumour sites were mostly oropharynx and larynx; 5221 (74%) patients had stage III-IV disease (UICC 2002). There was a significant survival benefit with altered fractionation radiotherapy, corresponding to an absolute benefit of 3.4% at five years (hazard ratio (HR) 0.92, 95% CI 0.86 to 0.97; P = 0.003). The benefit was significantly higher with hyperfractionated radiotherapy (8% at five years) than with accelerated radiotherapy (2% with accelerated fractionation without total dose reduction and 1.7% with total dose reduction at five years, P = 0.02). There was a benefit in locoregional control in favour of altered fractionation versus conventional radiotherapy (6.4% at five years; P < 0.0001), which was particularly efficient in reducing local failure, whereas the benefit on nodal control was less pronounced. The benefit was significantly higher in the youngest patients (under 50 year old) (HR 0.78, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.94), 0.95 (95% CI 0.83 to 1.09) for 51 to 60 year olds, 0.92 (95% CI 0.81 to 1.06) for 61 to 70 year olds, and 1.08 (95% CI 0.89 to 1.30) for those over 70 years old; test for trends P = 0.007). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Altered fractionation radiotherapy improves survival in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Comparison of the different types of altered radiotherapy suggests that hyperfractionation provides the greatest benefit. An update of this IPD meta-analysis (MARCH 2), which will increase the power of this analysis and allow for other comparisons, is currently in progress.	1a
24636740	Cutaneous melanoma: medical specialists' opinions on follow-up and sentinel lymph node biopsy.	BACKGROUND: The purpose, frequency and content of follow-up (FU) visits have been widely debated for all common malignancies, including melanoma. The aim was to gain insight into Dutch medical specialists' opinions on melanoma FU and to assess their views on sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). METHODS: All members of the Dutch Society of Surgical Oncology and the Dutch Society of Dermatology and Venereology were invited to complete a web-based questionnaire, consisting of 25 questions addressing the following topics: 1) respondent characteristics, 2) knowledge of national melanoma guideline, 3) opinions on melanoma FU, and 4) view on the significance of SLNB. RESULTS: A total of 378 respondents (response = 37%) started the survey, including 173 surgeons (46%) and 205 dermatologists (54%). Of these, 97% and 92% agreed that the purpose of FU is detection of local recurrence and second primary, respectively. Concerning frequency of FU in the first 10 years after diagnosis, 42% preferred a less frequent FU than indicated by the current guideline, while 4% preferred more frequent FU. Overall, twenty-five percent agreed that the standard diagnostics of cutaneous melanoma should include a SLNB, the percentage was highest amongst surgical residents (44%). CONCLUSION: The majority of specialists consider melanoma FU to be primarily an instrument to detect recurrences and secondary primaries. The frequency of FU, as prescribed by the current guideline, could be reduced according to 42%. The importance of SLNB seems to be insufficiently addressed in the Dutch guideline and by Dutch medical specialists despite its role in the AJCC staging system.	4
22217501	Is elective neck dissection necessary for the surgical management of T2N0 glottic carcinoma?	OBJECTIVE: Evaluation of neck metastasis incidence in surgically treated T2N0M0 glottic carcinoma patients and discussion the necessity of elective neck dissection in this subset of larynx carcinomas. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The patients who were staged clinically and radiologically as T2N0M0 glottic carcinoma having surgical intervention for their primary tumor and elective neck dissection between March 1996 and July 2009 with at least 2 years of follow up were included in the study. The recordings of patients were evaluated retrospectively for primary tumor location, vocal cord mobility, type of laryngectomy and neck dissection, results of histopathological examination, number of dissected lymph nodes for each specimen and for local and regional failure during the follow up. RESULTS: In the 13-year study period, 24 consecutive patients with a mean age of 56.4 were treated surgically with 20 frontolateral, three vertical laryngectomies and one cricohyoido-epiglottopexy; 19 lateral and 5 functional neck dissections were performed for the necks. Histopathological examinations of the neck dissection specimens revealed an average of 32 lymph nodes (8-65) and there was no metastasis in any of these specimens. After an average 58 months of follow-up, only one patient had local failure and no patients had regional failure. CONCLUSION: As occult metastasis was not detected in any of the neck dissection specimens in cT2N0M0 patients and no regional failure was experienced during the follow-up period, it was concluded that the neck could be followed up without performing elective neck dissection in the surgical management of cT2N0M0 glottic carcinoma patients.	2b
20421153	Dose escalation and quality of life in patients with localized prostate cancer treated with radiotherapy: long-term results of the Dutch randomized dose-escalation trial (CKTO 96-10 trial).	PURPOSE: To assess the impact of dose escalation of radiotherapy on quality of life (QoL) in prostate cancer patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Three hundred prostate cancer patients participating in the Dutch randomized trial (CKTO 69-10) comparing 68 Gy with 78 Gy were the subject of this analysis. These patients filled out the SF-36 QoL questionnaire before radiotherapy (baseline) and 6, 12, 24, and 36 months thereafter. Changes in QoL over time of >/=10 points were considered clinically relevant. Repeated-measures regression analyses were applied to estimate and test the QoL changes over time, the differences between the two arms, and for association with a number of covariates. RESULTS: At 3-year follow-up, the summary score physical health was 73.2 for the 68-Gy arm vs. 71.6 for the 78-Gy arm (p = 0.81), and the summary score mental health was 76.7 for the 68-Gy arm vs. 76.1 for the 78-Gy arm (p = 0.97). Statistically significant (p < 0.01) deterioration in QoL scores over time was registered in both arms in six scales. The deterioration over time was more pronounced in the high-dose arm for most scales. However, clinically relevant deterioration (>10 points) was seen for only two scales. None of the tested covariates were significantly correlated with QoL scores. CONCLUSION: Dose escalation did not result in significant deterioration of QoL in prostate cancer patients. In both randomization arms, statistically significant decreases in QoL scores over time were seen in six scales. The deterioration of QoL was more pronounced in the physical than in the mental health domain and in some scales more in the high- than in the low-dose arm, but the differences between arms were not statistically significant.	2a
24791630	Clinical impact of sentinel lymph node biopsy in patients with thick (>4 mm) melanomas.	BACKGROUND: The role of sentinel lymph node status (SLNS) in thick melanoma is evolving. The purpose of this study was to determine the prognostic value of SLNS in thick melanoma. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 120 prospectively collected clinically node-negative thick melanomas over 5 years was performed. Patient (age/sex) and tumor (thickness, ulceration, SLNS, mitoses, metastases, and recurrence) features were collected. Multivariate analysis was performed using Cox proportional hazard model. RESULTS: Factors predictive of positive SLN included male sex, ulceration, and high mitoses. Factors associated with positive SLN had higher local-regional recurrence and metastases than negative SLN. SLNS and tumor thickness impacted 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). Positive SLN, ulceration, age, and mitoses were independent predictors of DFS/OS. CONCLUSIONS: Nonulcerated/lower mitoses thick melanomas had lower positive SLN rates. Positive SLN develop recurrence and metastases and have worse OS/DFS. SLNS is an important prognosticator for OS/DFS. Sentinel lymph node biopsy delineates prognostic groups in thick melanomas and can impact management.	2a
10445610	Randomized trial of inhaled fluticasone propionate in chronic stable pulmonary sarcoidosis: a pilot study.	Pulmonary sarcoidosis is a disease in which the pathological processes are distributed along lymphatic pathways, particularly those around the bronchovascular bundles. Delivery of disease-modulating drugs by the inhaled route is therefore an attractive option. The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy of inhaled fluticasone propionate 2 mg x day(-1) in adults with stable pulmonary sarcoidosis. Forty-four adult patients (22 from each centre) were enrolled from outpatient clinics in two London teaching hospitals in a two centre, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. Primary end points were home recordings of peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR), forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), and forced vital capacity (FVC). Secondary end points were symptom scores, use of rescue bronchodilator medication, and clinic values for PEFR, FEV1, FVC, forced mid-expiratory flow (FEF25-75%), diffusion capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DL,CO), and total lung capacity (TLC). Symptom scores of cough, breathlessness and wheeze were lower in the active treatment group, but this did not reach statistical significance, and a general health perception assessment (Short Form (SF)-36) showed a difference between active and placebo treatment. No significant differences were found between the two groups in any physiological outcome measure. No new adverse reactions were detected. The results of this pilot study do not show an objective benefit of inhaled fluticasone propionate in pulmonary sarcoidosis where the disease is stable and is controlled without the use of inhaled corticosteroids.	1b
17038232	Predictive indicators for thyroid cartilage involvement in carcinoma of the larynx seen on spiral computed tomography scans.	OBJECTIVES: Recent studies have shown that the spiral computed tomography (CT) scan is a sensitive imaging modality for predicting neoplastic invasion of thyroid cartilage. The objectives of our study were: to assess the accuracy of pre-operative spiral CT in predicting thyroid cartilage involvement in patients with carcinoma of the larynx; and to elucidate the factors that would accurately indicate cartilage involvement. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Medical records, including spiral CT scans and pathological reports, were reviewed for 27 patients who had undergone laryngectomy in two major hospitals in south Wales. A consultant radiologist with special interest in cross-sectional imaging re-evaluated the scans to assess neoplastic involvement of the thyroid cartilage, based on definite, objective criteria. These criteria included: soft tissue asymmetry; loss of medullary space; spiky or irregular surface; distortion of cartilage framework; and abnormal soft tissue on both sides of the cartilage. The radiological findings were then correlated with the histopathological evidence of cartilage invasion by the tumour. RESULTS: Out of the 27 cases, 15 had evidence of histological invasion of thyroid cartilage. The most specific criterion to predict thyroid cartilage involvement was the presence of tumour on both sides of the cartilage (specificity of 91 per cent, sensitivity of 66 per cent). Combining two criteria increased both the sensitivity and the specificity to 86 and 91 per cent, respectively.	4
23117880	Asymptomatic brain metastases in patients with cutaneous metastatic malignant melanoma.	The aim of the study was to identify the frequency of asymptomatic brain metastases detected by computed tomography (CT) scans in patients with metastatic cutaneous melanoma referred to first-line systemic treatment. Between 1995 and 2009, 697 Danish patients were screened with a contrast-enhanced CT scan of the brain before the start of interleukin-2 (IL-2)-based immunotherapy. Among the 697 patients, 80 had asymptomatic brain metastases (12%). Patients' characteristics did not differ significantly between groups with and without brain metastases. Patients received systemic treatment (IL-2-based or cytotoxic chemotherapy), local treatment (stereotactic radiotherapy, whole-brain radiotherapy or surgery), or best supportive care only. The survival was significantly shorter for patients with asymptomatic brain metastases compared with patients without brain metastases (P<0.0001). The median survival was 4.5 versus 9.2 months; 1-year survival was 12.5 versus 38.4% for patients with or without asymptomatic brain metastases, respectively. We conclude that 12% of patients with metastatic cutaneous melanoma who qualified clinically for IL-2 treatment had asymptomatic brain metastases, detected by CT scans with contrast. Proper staging of metastatic cutaneous melanoma including contrast-enhanced CT of neck, thorax, and abdomen and contrast-enhanced MRI of the brain is mandatory, as systemic treatment options with comparable safety and efficacy in patients with and without brain metastases have emerged.	3b
15681524	Androgen suppression plus radiation versus radiation alone for patients with stage D1/pathologic node-positive adenocarcinoma of the prostate: updated results based on national prospective randomized trial Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 85-31.	PURPOSE: To update the effect of immediate androgen suppression in conjunction with standard external-beam irradiation versus radiation alone on a group of histologically lymph node-positive patients with adenocarcinoma of the prostate. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A national prospective randomized trial (Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 85-31) of standard external-beam irradiation plus immediate androgen suppression versus external-beam irradiation alone was initiated in 1985 for patients with locally advanced adenocarcinoma of the prostate. One hundred seventy-three patients in this trial had histologically involved lymph nodes. Ninety-eight patients received radiation plus immediate androgen suppression (luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone [LHRH] agonist), whereas 75 patients received radiation alone with hormonal manipulation instituted at the time of relapse. RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 6.5 years for all patients and 9.5 years for living patients, estimated progression-free survival with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level less than 1.5 ng/mL at 5 and 9 years was 54% and 33%, respectively, for patients who received immediate LHRH agonist versus 10% [corrected] and 4% for patients who received radiation alone with hormonal manipulation instituted at time of relapse (P < .0001). Multivariate analysis revealed radiation therapy and immediate hormonal manipulation as having a statistically significant impact on all end points analyzed: absolute survival, disease-specific failure, metastatic failure, and biochemical control with PSA less than 4 ng/mL and less than 1.5 ng/mL. CONCLUSION: Pending the results of randomized trials, patients with adenocarcinoma of the prostate who have pathologically involved pelvic lymph nodes (pathologic node-positive or clinical stage D1) should be considered for external-beam irradiation plus immediate hormonal manipulation rather than radiation alone with hormone manipulation at the time of relapse.	1a
21898134	Accuracy of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale as a screening tool in cancer patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis.	PURPOSE: The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) is the most extensively validated scale for screening emotional distress in cancer patients. However, thresholds for clinical decision making vary widely across studies. A meta-analysis was conducted with the aim of identifying optimal, empirically derived cut-offs. METHODS: PubMed, Embase, and PsycINFO databases were searched for studies that compared the HADS total and its subscale scores against a semi-structured or structured clinical interview as a reference standard with regard to its screening efficacy for any mental disorders and depressive disorders alone. Separate pooled analyses were conducted for single or two adjacent thresholds. A total of 28 studies (inter-rater agreement, kappa = 0.86) were included. RESULTS: The best thresholds for screening for mental disorders were 10 or 11 on the HADS total (sensitivity 0.80; specificity 0.74), 5 on the HADS depression subscale (sensitivity 0.84; specificity 0.50), and 7 or 8 on the HADS anxiety subscale (sensitivity 0.73; specificity 0.65). Respective thresholds for depression screening were 15 for the HADS total (sensitivity 0.87; specificity 0.88), 7 for the HADS depression subscale (sensitivity 0.86; specificity 0.81), and 10 or 11 for the HADS anxiety subscale (sensitivity 0.63; specificity 0.83). CONCLUSIONS: The HADS anxiety subscale performed worse than the total and the depression subscales for both indicators. Diagnostic accuracy varied widely by threshold but was consistently superior for depression screening than for screening of any mental disorder.	1a
12100928	Epidemiologic association between prostatitis and prostate cancer.	OBJECTIVES: To quantify the relationship between prostatitis and prostate cancer by pooling previous epidemiologic studies of this association. METHODS: A comprehensive search for articles published through 2000 was performed, blinded reviews of each study were conducted, data were abstracted, and all such studies were pooled. RESULTS: In this meta-analysis, an increased risk was seen among men with a history of prostatitis (odds ratio = 1.6), particularly with population-based case-control studies (odds ratio = 1.8). Increased relative risk estimates were also seen among men with a history of syphilis and a history of gonorrhea. CONCLUSIONS: These associations with prostate cancer suggest that infections may represent one mechanism through which prostate cancer develops. However, causality is unclear, because recall bias and detection bias cannot be ruled out. Future cohort studies of prostate cancer should examine sexually transmitted infections, as well as other infections, as potential risk factors.	2a
21861286	(1)(8)F-FDG PET/CT and MRI in the follow-up of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.	We evaluated the diagnostic performance of (18)F-FDG PET/CT and MRI for the assessment of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) relapse. Since early treatment might prevent inoperable relapse, we also evaluated THE performance of early unenhanced (18)F-FDG PET/CT in residual tumor detection. The study was prospectively performed on 32 patients who underwent (18)F-FDG PET/CT and MRI before treatment and at 4 and 12 months after treatment. (18)F-FDG PET/CT was also performed 2 weeks after the end of radiotherapy. Histopathology or a minimum of 18 months follow-up were used as gold standard. Before treatment (18)F-FDG PET/CT and MRI detected all primary tumors except for two limited vocal fold lesions (sensitivity 94%). MRI was more sensitive than (18)F-FDG PET/CT for the detection of local extension sites (sensitivity 75 vs 58%), but at the cost of a higher rate of false positive results (positive predictive value 74 vs 86%). For relapse detection at 4 months, sensitivity was significantly higher for (18)F-FDG PET/CT (92%) than for MRI (70%), but the diagnostic performances were not significantly different at 12 months. For the detection of residual malignant tissue 2 weeks post-radiotherapy, sensitivity and specificity of (18)F-FDG PET/CT were respectively 86 and 85% (SUV cut-off value 5.8). (18)F-FDG PET/CT is effective in the differentiation between residual tumor and radiation-induced changes, as early as 2 weeks after treatment of a primary HNSCC. For follow-up, performance of (18)F-FDG PET/CT and MRI are similar except for a higher sensitivity of (18)F-FDG PET/CT at 4 months.	3b
19289266	Radiation dose predicts for biochemical control in intermediate-risk prostate cancer patients treated with low-dose-rate brachytherapy.	PURPOSE: To evaluate the influence of patient- and treatment-related factors on freedom from biochemical failure (FFbF) in patients with intermediate-risk prostate cancer. METHODS AND MATERIALS: From a prospectively collected database of 2250 men treated at Mount Sinai Hospital from 1990 to 2004 with low-dose-rate brachytherapy for prostate cancer, 558 men with either one or more intermediate-risk features (prostate-specific antigen [PSA] level 10-20 ng/mL, Gleason score 7, or Stage T2b) were identified who had a minimum follow-up of 24 months and postimplant CT-based dosimetric analysis. Biologically effective dose (BED) values were calculated to compare doses from different isotopes and treatment regimens. Patients were treated with brachytherapy with or without hormone therapy and/or external-beam radiotherapy. Patient- and treatment-related factors were analyzed with respect to FFbF. The median follow-up was 60 months (range, 24-167 months). Biochemical failure was defined according to the Phoenix definition. Univariate analyses were used to determine whether any variable was predictive of FFbF. A two-sided p value of <0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: Overall, the actuarial FFbF at 10 years was 86%. Dose (BED <150 Gy(2) vs. >or=150 Gy(2)) was the only significant predictor of FFbF (p < 0.001). None of the other variables (PSA, external-beam radiotherapy, Gleason score, treatment type, hormones, stage, and number of risk factors) was found to be a statistically significant predictor of 10-year FFbF. CONCLUSIONS: Radiation dose is an important predictor of FFbF in intermediate-risk prostate cancer. Treatment should continue to be individualized according to presenting disease characteristics until results from Radiation Therapy Oncology Group trial 0232 become available.	3a
19233410	A multi-institutional evaluation of active surveillance for low risk prostate cancer.	PURPOSE: For select men with low risk prostate cancer active surveillance is more often being considered a management strategy. In a multicenter retrospective study we evaluated the actuarial rates and predictors of remaining on active surveillance, the incidence of cancer progression and the pathological findings of delayed radical prostatectomy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cohort of 262 men from 4 institutions met the inclusion criteria of age 75 years or younger, prostate specific antigen 10 ng/ml or less, clinical stage T1-T2a, biopsy Gleason sum 6 or less, 3 or less positive cores at diagnostic biopsy, repeat biopsy before active surveillance and no treatment for 6 months following the repeat biopsy. Active surveillance started on the date of the second biopsy. Actuarial rates of remaining on active surveillance were calculated and univariate Cox regression was used to assess predictors of discontinuing active surveillance. RESULTS: With a median followup of 29 months 43 patients ultimately received active treatment. The 2 and 5-year probabilities of remaining on active surveillance were 91% and 75%, respectively. Patients with cancer on the second biopsy (HR 2.23, 95% CI 1.23-4.06, p = 0.007) and a higher number of cancerous cores from the 2 biopsies combined (p = 0.002) were more likely to undergo treatment. Age, prostate specific antigen, clinical stage, prostate volume and number of total biopsy cores sampled were not predictive of outcome. Skeletal metastases developed in 1 patient 38 months after starting active surveillance. Of the 43 patients undergoing delayed treatment 41 (95%) are without disease progression at a median of 23 months following treatment. CONCLUSIONS: With a median followup of 29 months active surveillance for select patients appears to be safe and associated with a low risk of systemic progression. Cancer at restaging biopsy and a higher total number of cancerous cores are associated with a lower likelihood of remaining on active surveillance. A restaging biopsy should be strongly considered to finalize eligibility for active surveillance.	3a
20495653	Predicting patient survival after pancreaticoduodenectomy for malignancy: histopathological criteria based on perineural infiltration and lymphovascular invasion.	BACKGROUND: Accurate and simple prognostic criteria based on histopathology following pancreaticoduodenectomy would be helpful in assessing prognosis and considering and evaluating adjuvant therapy. This study analysed the histological parameters influencing outcome following pancreaticoduodenectomy for periampullary malignancy. METHODS: A total of 110 pancreaticoduodenectomies were performed from 1998 to 2008. The median age of patients was 69 years (range 20-89 years). The median follow-up was 4.9 years. Of the procedures, 87% (96) were performed for malignancies and the remainder (n= 14) for benign aetiologies. Of the 96 malignancies, 60 were pancreatic adenocarcinoma and the rest were ampullary (14), cholangio (9), duodenal (9) carcinomas and others. Statistical analysis was performed using log-rank and Cox regression multivariate analyses. RESULTS: Patients who underwent resection had 1-, 3- and 5-year survival rates of 70%, 46% and 41%, respectively. The 1-, 3- and 5-year survival rates for periampullary cancers other than pancreatic adenocarcinoma were 83%, 69% and 61%, respectively; those for pancreatic adenocarcinoma were 62%, 31% and 27%, respectively (P < 0.003). Poor tumour differentiation (P < 0.02), tumour size >3 cm (P < 0.04), margin <or=2 mm (P < 0.02), nodal involvement (P < 0.003), perineural infiltration (P < 0.0001) and lymphovascular invasion (P < 0.002) were associated with poorer prognosis. In a multivariate analysis, histologically identified perineural infiltration (P < 0.03) and lymphovascular invasion (P= 0.05) were significant factors influencing outcome. Five-year survival was 77% in patients negative for both factors and 15% in patients positive for both (P < 0.0001). In the pancreatic adenocarcinoma subgroup, patients who were negative for both factors had a 5-year survival of 71%, whereas those who were positive for both had a 5-year survival of 16% (P < 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: The presence of perineural infiltration and lymphovascular invasion on histopathology is highly significant in predicting 5-year outcomes after pancreaticoduodenectomy for periampullary and pancreatic malignancies.	4
23602325	The effectiveness of acupressure for the control and management of chemotherapy-related acute and delayed nausea: a randomized controlled trial.	CONTEXT: Both positive and negative results have been reported in the literature from the use of acupressure at the P6 point, providing evidence of highly suggestive but not conclusive results. OBJECTIVES: To clarify whether acupressure is effective in the management of chemotherapy-related nausea and vomiting. METHODS: A randomized, three-group, sham-controlled trial was designed. Patients with cancer receiving chemotherapy were randomized to receive standardized antiemetics and acupressure wristbands, sham acupressure wristbands, or antiemetics alone. Primary outcome assessment (nausea) was carried out daily for seven days per chemotherapy cycle over four cycles. Secondary outcomes included vomiting, psychological distress, and quality of life. RESULTS: Five hundred patients were randomized. Primary outcome analysis (nausea in Cycle 1) revealed no statistically significant differences between the three groups, although nausea levels in the proportion of patients using wristbands (both real and sham) were somewhat lower than those in the proportion of patients using antiemetics-only group. Adjusting for gender, age, and emetic risk of chemotherapy, the odds ratio of lower nausea experience was 1.18 and 1.42 for the acupressure and sham acupressure groups, respectively. A gender interaction effect was evident (P = 0.002). No significant differences were detected in relation to vomiting, anxiety, and quality-of-life measures. CONCLUSION: No clear recommendations can be made about the use of acupressure wristbands in the management of chemotherapy-related nausea and vomiting as results did not reach statistical significance. However, the study provided evidence of encouraging signals in relation to improved nausea experience and warrants further consideration in both practice and further clinical trials. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial is registered with the ISRCT register, number ISRCTN87604299.	1b
30889085	Endometrial safety of low-dose vaginal estrogens in menopausal women: a systematic evidence review.	OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to systematically review studies that evaluated endometrial hyperplasia or cancer incidence with unopposed vaginal estrogens. METHODS: PubMed and EMBASE were searched from inception to August 2017 for relevant articles and abstracts. Bibliographies of review articles and abstracts of major women's health medical meetings were examined. Eligible studies (independently reviewed by 4 authors) had to report menopausal vaginal estrogen use and endometrial histology, or incidence of endometrial hyperplasia or cancer. RESULTS: Of 5,593 abstracts from the literature search and 47 articles from other sources, 36 articles and 2 abstracts were eligible, describing 20 randomized controlled studies, 8 interventional studies, and 10 observational studies. Collectively, the studies did not support an increased risk of endometrial hyperplasia or cancer with low-dose vaginal estrogens. Rates of endometrial cancer and hyperplasia were 0.03% and 0.4%, respectively, from 20 randomized controlled trials (2,983 women) of vaginal estrogens. Overall, reports of endometrial hyperplasia were observed with various doses and durations and appeared sporadic (except 1.25 mg conjugated equine estrogens), consistent with endometrial hyperplasia rates in the general population. A Denmark registry study was an exception and may be of limited applicability to the United States. The Women's Health Initiative Observational Study showed no association (1.3 cases/1,000 women-years with vaginal estrogens versus 1.0/1,000 women-years for nonuse). CONCLUSION: This systematic review supports the use of low-dose vaginal estrogens for treating vulvar and vaginal atrophy in menopausal women without a concomitant progestogen. This review does not support increased endometrial hyperplasia or cancer risk with low-dose, unopposed vaginal estrogens; however, longer-term, real-world data are needed.	2a
18640931	Analysis of fluorouracil-based adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation after pancreaticoduodenectomy for ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreas: results of a large, prospectively collected database at the Johns Hopkins Hospital.	PURPOSE: To examine the efficacy of adjuvant chemoradiotherapy after pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) for pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PC) in patients undergoing resection at Johns Hopkins Hospital (JHH; Baltimore, MD). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between August 30, 1993, and February 28, 2005, a total of 908 patients underwent PD for PC at JHH. A prospective database was reviewed to determine which patients received fluorouracil (FU) -based CRT. Excluded patients had metastatic disease, died 60 or fewer days after PD, received preoperative therapy, an experimental vaccine, adjuvant chemotherapy or radiation alone. The final cohort includes 616 patients. RESULTS: The median follow-up was 17.8 months (interquartile range, 9.7 to 33.5 months). Overall median survival was 17.9 months (95% CI, 16.3 to 19.5 months). Groups were similar with respect to tumor size, nodal status, and margin status, but the CRT group was younger (P < .001), and less likely to present with a severe comorbid disease (P = .001). Patients with carcinomas larger than 3 cm (P = .001), grade 3 and 4 (P < .001), margin-positive resection (P = .001), and complications after surgery (P = .017) had poor long-term survival. Patients receiving CRT experienced an improved median (21.2 v 14.4 months; P < .001), 2-year (43.9% v 31.9%), and 5-year (20.1% v 15.4%) survival compared with no CRT. After controlling for high-risk features, CRT was still associated with improved survival (relative risk = 0.74; 95% CI, 0.62 to 0.89). CONCLUSION: These data suggest that adjuvant concurrent FU-based CRT significantly improves survival after PD for PC when compared with patients not receiving CRT. These data support the use of combined adjuvant CRT for PC.	2b
20798386	High-dose isoflavones do not improve metabolic and inflammatory parameters in androgen-deprived men with prostate cancer.	The profound hypogonadism that occurs with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) for prostate cancer (PCa) results in complications such as diabetes and metabolic syndrome that predispose to cardiovascular disease. Because phytoestrogens have been associated with an improvement in metabolic parameters, we evaluated their role in men undergoing ADT. Our objective was to evaluate the effects of high-dose isoflavones on metabolic and inflammatory parameters in men undergoing ADT. This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 12-week pilot study. Participants were randomly assigned to receive 20 g of soy protein containing 160 mg of total isoflavones vs taste-matched placebo (20 g whole milk protein). The study was conducted at a tertiary care center in the United States. Thirty-three men (isoflavones = 17, placebo = 16) undergoing ADT for PCa completed this pilot study. Mean age in the 2 groups was 69 years and the majority of men were Caucasians. Mean duration of ADT in both groups was approximately 2 years (P = .70). The 2 groups were well matched at baseline. After 12 weeks of intervention, there was no significant difference in either metabolic or inflammatory parameters between the 2 groups. We found that high-dose isoflavones over a course of 12 weeks do not improve metabolic or inflammatory parameters in androgen-deprived men.	2b
2314103	Is long-term follow-up justified after excision of a thin melanoma (less than or equal to 1.5 mm)? A retrospective analysis of 206 patients.	From 1964 to 1988, 231 patients underwent local excision as the single treatment of melanoma with a thickness of less than or equal to 1.5 mm. We investigated the prognostic value of several factors on cancer-specific survival and cancer-specific disease-free survival, from time of excision on, by performing life-table analysis on 206 evaluable patients. Recurrence developed in 11 patients; local recurrence occurred in four patients, hematogenic spread in three patients and lymph node metastases in another four patients. Six patients died as a result of the disease. Tumors with a thickness of less than or equal to 1.5 mm have an excellent prognosis regardless of the localization of the melanoma. At 15 years cancer-specific survival was 92.3% and cancer-specific disease-free survival was 86.9%. Recurrence was successfully treated with hope for cure in 4 patients. This figures does not justify aggressive follow-up for all patients.	3b
24745696	Adjuvant bevacizumab in patients with melanoma at high risk of recurrence (AVAST-M): preplanned interim results from a multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled phase 3 study.	BACKGROUND: Bevacizumab, a monoclonal antibody that targets VEGF, has shown restricted activity in patients with advanced melanoma. We aimed to assess the role of bevacizumab as adjuvant treatment for patients with resected melanoma at high risk of recurrence. We report results from the preplanned interim analysis. METHODS: We did a multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled phase 3 trial at 48 centres in the UK between July 18, 2007, and March 29, 2012. Patients aged 16 years or older with American Joint Committee on Cancer stage (AJCC) stage IIB, IIC, and III cutaneous melanoma were randomly allocated (1:1), via a central, computer-based minimisation procedure, to receive intravenous bevacizumab 7.5 mg/kg, every 3 weeks for 1 year, or to observation. Randomisation was stratified by Breslow thickness of the primary tumour, N stage according to AJCC staging criteria, ulceration of the primary tumour, and patient sex. The primary endpoint was overall survival; secondary endpoints included disease-free interval, distant-metastases interval and quality of life. Analysis was by intention-to-treat. This trial is registered as an International Standardised Randomised Controlled Trial, number ISRCTN81261306. FINDINGS: 1343 patients were randomised to either the bevacizumab group (n=671) or the observation group (n=672). Median follow-up was 25 months (IQR 16-37) in the bevacizumab group and 25 months (17-37) in the observation group. At the time of interim analysis, 286 (21%) of 1343 enrolled patients had died: 140 (21%) of 671 patients in the bevacizumab group, and 146 (22%) of 672 patients in the observation group. 134 (96%) of patients in the bevacizumab group died because of melanoma versus 139 (95%) in the observation group. We noted no significant difference in overall survival between treatment groups (hazard ratio [HR] 0.97, 95% CI 0.78-1.22; p=0.76); this finding persisted after adjustment for stratification variables (HR 1.03; 95% CI 0.81-1.29; p=0.83). Median duration of treatment with bevacizumab was 51 weeks (IQR 21-52) and dose intensity was 86% (41-96), showing good tolerability. 180 grade 3 or 4 adverse events were recorded in 101 (15%) of 671 patients in the bevacizumab group, and 36 (5%) of 672 patients in the observation group. Bevacizumab resulted in a higher incidence of grade 3 hypertension than did observation (41 [6%] vs one [<1%]). There was an improvement in disease-free interval for patients in the bevacizumab group compared with those in the observation group (HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.70-0.98, p=0.03), but no significant difference between groups for distant-metastasis-free interval (HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.73-1.06, p=0.18). No significant differences were noted between treatment groups in the standardised area under the curve for any of the quality-of-life scales over 36 months. Three adverse drug reactions were regarded as both serious and unexpected: one patient had optic neuritis after the first bevacizumab infusion, a second patient had persistent erectile dysfunction, and a third patient died of a haemopericardium after receiving two bevacizumab infusions and was later identified to have had significant predisposing cardiovascular risk factors. INTERPRETATION: Bevacizumab has promising tolerability. Longer follow-up is needed to identify an effect on the primary endpoint of overall survival at 5 years.	1b
30014862	The benefits and risks of asking research participants about suicide: A meta-analysis of the impact of exposure to suicide-related content.	One obstacle potentially hindering research on suicide is the assumption that assessing suicide may make individuals more likely to engage in suicidal thoughts or behaviours; a concern expressed by ethics committees, researchers, and clinicians. However, decisions which are overly cautious and restrictive when approving research proposals will hinder important research in this area. The present aim was to conduct a meta-analysis to examine whether asking about suicide or exposure to suicide-related content in research studies led to changes in participants' levels of distress, suicidal ideation, or suicide attempts. A systematic search of peer-reviewed and unpublished literature from 2000 to 2017 identified 18 studies. Exposure to suicide-related content led to significant, albeit small, reductions in suicidal ideation (g=-0.13, p<.001) and a lower likelihood of engaging in suicidal behaviour (OR=0.714, p<.05). The reduction in suicidal ideation was moderated by age such that adolescents showed nearly twice as large a reduction in suicidal ideation from pre- to post-exposure as adults did. Thus, evidence to date suggests that asking research participants about suicide does not increase risk, and may be associated with small benefits. Ethics review boards should calibrate their consideration of the risks associated with participation based on the available evidence and relative to the cost of depriving potential participants of any benefits that participation may offer.	1b
24362908	Cryotherapy for docetaxel-induced hand and nail toxicity: randomised control trial.	PURPOSE: This study investigated the efficacy and safety of cryotherapy, in the form of frozen gel gloves, in relation to docetaxel-induced hand and fingernail toxicities. PATIENTS AND METHODS: After piloting with 21 patients, a consecutive series sample of patients (n=53) prescribed docetaxel every 3 weeks, for a minimum of three cycles, was enrolled in this randomised control trial. Participants acted as their own control, with the frozen gel glove worn on one randomised hand for 15 min prior to infusion, for the duration of the infusion, and for 15 min of after completion of treatment. Hand and nail toxicities were evaluated by two blinded assessors according to CTCAE.v4 criteria. To assess the potential for cross-infection of multi-use gloves, microbial culture and sensitivity swabs were taken of each glove at every tenth use. RESULTS: Of the 53 participants enrolled in the main study, 21 provided evaluable data. There was a 60 % withdrawal rate due to patient discomfort with the intervention. The mean incidence and severity of toxicities in all evaluable cycles in control and intervention hands respectively were erythroderma grade 1 (5/5 %), nail discolouration grade 1 (81/67 %), nail loss grade 1 (19/19 %) and nail ridging grade 1 (57/57 %). No significant differences were determined between hand conditions in terms of time to event, nor in terms of toxicity in gloved and non-gloved hands. CONCLUSION: While cryotherapy in the form of frozen gloves for the cutaneous toxicities associated with docetaxel is safe, its limited efficacy, patient discomfort and some logistical issues preclude its use in our clinical setting.	1b
24535597	Utility of confocal laser endomicroscopy in identifying high-grade dysplasia and adenocarcinoma in Barrett's esophagus: a systematic review and meta-analysis.	Confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE) is a novel endoscopic technique that has emerged as an important tool in the in-vivo visualization and detailed assessment of the mucosal layer and subcellular structures in Barrett's esophagus. Current guidelines recommend four-quadrant random biopsies for identification of high-grade dysplasia (HGD) in Barrett's esophagus. However, random biopsies are associated with sampling error and inconsistent histopathologic interpretation. CLE, by providing targeted biopsies, could decrease the sampling error and increase the yield of detection of HGD/adenocarcinoma [esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC)]. We carried out a meta-analysis to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of the CLE-based targeted biopsies in detecting HGD/adenocarcinoma compared with four-quadrant random biopsies. A search using medical subject headings (MeSH) terms and keywords was performed in the MEDLINE and Cochrane review databases and relevant studies were identified. All the studies that compared the diagnostic yield from CLE-based targeted biopsies to detect HGD/adenocarcinoma with a gold standard of histopathology were included and a meta-analysis was carried out to estimate the pooled sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative likelihood ratios using Meta-Disc software. There were a total of seven studies with 345 patients and 3080 lesions that were finally included in the meta-analysis. All the studies had reported per-lesion analyses; however, only four of the seven studies had data reported on per-patient analyses. 'Per-lesion' analysis for the diagnosis of HGD/adenocarcinoma yielded a pooled sensitivity and specificity of 68% [95% confidence interval (CI) of 64-73%] and 88% (95% CI of 87-89%), respectively. The pooled positive and negative likelihood ratios were 6.56 (95% CI of 3.61-11.90) and 0.24 (95% CI of 0.09-0.63), respectively. Similar numbers were calculated on the basis of 'per-patient' basis, which showed a pooled sensitivity and specificity of 86% (95% CI of 74-96%) and 83% (95% CI of 77-88%), respectively. The pooled positive and negative likelihood ratios were 5.61 (95% CI of 2.00-15.69) and 0.21 (95% CI of 0.08-0.59), respectively. CLE, by providing targeted biopsies, has a good diagnostic accuracy in identifying HGD/EAC; however, the overall prevalence of HGD/EAC in the studies included was much higher than what would be seen in clinical practice and these results should be interpreted with caution. Because of its relatively low sensitivity and negative predictive value, CLE may currently not replace standard biopsy techniques for the diagnosis of HGD/EAC in Barrett's esophagus.	2a
31094582	Effects of lymphadenectomy among women with stage IA endometrial cancer: a SEER database analysis.	Aim: To determine whether lymphadenectomy is associated with increased survival of women with stage IA endometrial cancer. Methods: Patients diagnosed with endometrial cancer from 2004 to 2013 and whose clinicopathologic data were recorded in the SEER database were examined. Propensity matching paired subjects with similar background variables. Before and after matching, Kaplan-Meier curves were drawn for comparison. Results: In 11,603 patients, cardiovascular disease and diabetes were the most common causes of death. Before matching, lymphadenectomy significantly improved the overall survival of stage IA/grade 3-4 patients (p = 0.013), but after matching, lymphadenectomy did not prolong survival for any grade. Sentinel lymph nodes biopsy can reduce the number of resected lymph nodes (p = 8.387e-10 in Wilcox test) but can't prolong survival. Conclusion: After matching, no significant difference in survival between lymphadenectomy and nonlymphadenectomy was observed for stage IA patients, sentinel lymph nodes group had fewer lymph node removed, but didn't affect survival.	4
25713437	Five-year survival rates for treatment-naive patients with advanced melanoma who received ipilimumab plus dacarbazine in a phase III trial.	PURPOSE: There is evidence from nonrandomized studies that a proportion of ipilimumab-treated patients with advanced melanoma experience long-term survival. To demonstrate a long-term survival benefit with ipilimumab, we evaluated the 5-year survival rates of patients treated in a randomized, controlled phase III trial. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A milestone survival analysis was conducted to capture the 5-year survival rate of treatment-naive patients with advanced melanoma who received ipilimumab in a phase III trial. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive ipilimumab at 10 mg/kg plus dacarbazine (n = 250) or placebo plus dacarbazine (n = 252) at weeks 1, 4, 7, and 10 followed by dacarbazine alone every 3 weeks through week 22. Eligible patients could receive maintenance ipilimumab or placebo every 12 weeks beginning at week 24. A safety analysis was conducted on patients who survived at least 5 years and continued to receive ipilimumab as maintenance therapy. RESULTS: The 5-year survival rate was 18.2% (95% CI, 13.6% to 23.4%) for patients treated with ipilimumab plus dacarbazine versus 8.8% (95% CI, 5.7% to 12.8%) for patients treated with placebo plus dacarbazine (P = .002). A plateau in the survival curve began at approximately 3 years. In patients who survived at least 5 years and continued to receive ipilimumab, grade 3 or 4 immune-related adverse events were observed exclusively in the skin. CONCLUSION: The additional survival benefit of ipilimumab plus dacarbazine is maintained with twice as many patients alive at 5 years compared with those who initially received placebo plus dacarbazine. These results demonstrate a durable survival benefit with ipilimumab in advanced melanoma.	2b
24943918	The effects of mindfulness-based stress reduction on objective and subjective sleep parameters in women with breast cancer: a randomized controlled trial.	OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of mindfulness-based stress reduction for breast cancer survivors (MBSR(BC)) on multiple measures of objective and subjective sleep parameters among breast cancer survivors (BCS). METHODS: Data were collected using a two-armed randomized controlled design among BCS enrolled in either a 6-week MBSR(BC) program or a usual care (UC) group with a 12-week follow-up. The present analysis is a subset of the larger parent trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01177124). Seventy-nine BCS participants (mean age 57 years), stages 0-III, were randomly assigned to either the formal (in-class) 6-week MBSR(BC) program or UC. Subjective sleep parameters (SSP) (i.e., sleep diaries and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)) and objective sleep parameters (OSP) (i.e., actigraphy) were measured at baseline, 6 weeks, and 12 weeks after completing the MBSR(BC) or UC program. RESULTS: Results showed indications of a positive effect of MBSR(BC) on OSP at 12 weeks on sleep efficiency (78.2% MBSR(BC) group versus 74.6% UC group, p = 0.04), percent of sleep time (81.0% MBSR(BC) group versus 77.4% UC group, p = 0.02), and less number waking bouts (93.5 in MBSR(BC) group versus 118.6 in the UC group, p < 0.01). Small nonsignificant improvements were found in SSP in the MBSR(BC) group from baseline to 6 weeks (PSQI total score, p = 0.09). No significant relationship was observed between minutes of MBSR(BC) practice and SSP or OSP. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that MBSR(BC) may be an efficacious treatment to improve objective and subjective sleep parameters in BCS.	2b
27406859	Tomato-based randomized controlled trial in prostate cancer patients: Effect on PSA.	BACKGROUND & AIMS: The effect of lycopene-containing foods in prostate cancer development remains undetermined. We tested whether a lycopene-rich tomato intervention could reduce the levels of prostate specific antigen (PSA) in prostate cancer patients. METHODS: Prior to their curative treatment, 79 patients with prostate cancer were randomized to a nutritional intervention with either 1) tomato products containing 30 mg lycopene per day; 2) tomato products plus selenium, omega-3 fatty acids, soy isoflavones, grape/pomegranate juice, and green/black tea (tomato-plus); or 3) control diet for 3 weeks. RESULTS: The main analysis, which included patients in all risk categories, did not reveal differences in changes of PSA-values between the intervention and control groups. Post-hoc, exploratory analyses within intermediate risk (n = 41) patients based on tumor classification and Gleason score post-surgery, revealed that median PSA decreased significantly in the tomato group as compared to controls (-2.9% and +6.5% respectively, p = 0.016). In separate post-hoc analyses, we observed that median PSA-values decreased by 1% in patients with the highest increases in plasma lycopene, selenium and C20:5 n-3 fatty acid, compared to an 8.5% increase in the patients with the lowest increase in lycopene, selenium and C20:5 n-3 fatty acid (p = 0.003). Also, PSA decreased in patients with the highest increase in lycopene alone (p = 0.009). CONCLUSIONS: Three week nutritional interventions with tomato-products alone or in combination with selenium and n-3 fatty acids lower PSA in patients with non-metastatic prostate cancer. Our observation suggests that the effect may depend on both aggressiveness of the disease and the blood levels of lycopene, selenium and omega-3 fatty acids.	1b
8791271	Prognostic value of serum analyses of S-100 beta protein in malignant melanoma.	S-100 protein was first described in the central nervous system but is also present in malignant melanoma cells. Immunohistochemical detection of S-100 is widely used in the histopathological diagnosis of malignant melanoma. In the present study serum levels of S-100 beta protein were measured in 643 patients with cutaneous malignant melanoma. An immunoradiometric assay with three monoclonal antibodies against bovine S-100 protein beta subunit was used. At the time of blood sampling 553 patients were in clinical stage I, 24 in clinical stage II and 66 in clinical stage III. The overall survival rate was strongly associated with serum levels of S-100 protein. The observed/ expected death ratio was markedly increased with increasing levels of S-100 beta (P < 0.001). A fivefold increase in relative hazard was indicated by a value of S-100 beta exceeding 0.6 microgram/l (P < 0.001) and when this cut-off level was used S-100 beta had additional prognostic value independent of clinical stage (P < 0.001). Our data strongly suggest that S-100 beta in serum is an independent prognostic marker that may be useful in identifying high-risk cases and monitoring response to therapy in patients with malignant melanoma.	2b
19102395	Survival benefit of pancreaticoduodenectomy in a Japanese fashion for a limited group of patients with pancreatic head cancer.	BACKGROUND/AIMS: To evaluate the clinical benefit of pancreaticoduodenectomy in a Japanese fashion for patients with pancreatic head cancer. METHODOLOGY: One hundred and one patients underwent pancreatectomy for pancreatic head cancer between 1980 and 2001. Of these, 40 patients in the extended resection (ER) group had an extended lymphadenectomy and neural plexus dissection as a Japanese fashion, while 61 patients in the conventional resection (CR) group. Tumor status, morbidity, mortality, survival and pattern of recurrence were retrospectively studied. RESULTS: The incidence of R0 operations in the ER group was higher than that in the CR group (p<0.01). The actuarial 5-year survival rate (30.6%) of patients with pStage IIA or IIB in the ER group was significantly higher than that (8.2%) in the CR group (p=0.04) because local recurrence (47%) in the CR group was higher than that (25%) in the ER group (p=0.02). In an immunohistochemical study of isolated tumor cells (ITCs), 13 patients (57%) with lymph node ITCs were included in the 23 pN0 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Pancreaticoduodenectomy in a Japanese fashion with an adequate extended resection might bring a survival benefit for patients with pStage IIA or IIB pancreatic head cancer.	4
9145718	Recommended prostate-specific antigen testing intervals for the detection of curable prostate cancer.	OBJECTIVE: To evaluate prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing intervals that maintain the detection of curable cancer and reduce unnecessary testing. DESIGN AND PATIENTS: Historical prospective study of serial PSA measurements at 2- and 4-year intervals from frozen serum samples of 40 men who eventually developed prostate cancer and 272 men without prostate cancer who were participants in a prospective aging study (Gerontology Research Center of the National Institute on Aging, the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging) and the case series of 389 consecutive men treated surgically for nonpalpable prostate cancer. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Probability of a PSA conversion to 4.1 to 5.0 ng/mL and to greater than 5.0 ng/mL at 2 and 4 years and probability of detecting curable prostate cancer by age and PSA level. RESULTS: When the pretreatment PSA level was less than or equal to 4.0 ng/mL, nonpalpable prostate cancers were highly likely (34/36, 94%) to be curable (organ-confined or capsular penetration with Gleason score < 7 and negative margins), and the majority (25/36, 69%) were small cancers (confined tumor < or = 0.5 cm3 with no Gleason pattern 4 or 5). When the pretreatment PSA level was greater than 4.0 ng/mL and less than or equal to 5.0 ng/mL, cancers were highly likely to be curable (32/36, 89%), and a minority were small cancers (12/36, 33%). When the pretreatment PSA level was greater than 5.0 ng/mL, 96 (30%) of 317 cancers were noncurable. The PSA conversion (for cancer cases) to a level at which cure is less likely (> 5.0 ng/mL) is rare (0%) after 2 or 4 years when the initial PSA is less than 2.0 ng/mL. PSA conversion to a range at which cancers are likely to be curable and less likely to be small (4.1-5.0 ng/mL) is rare after 2 years (0%-4%) when the baseline PSA level is less than 2.0 ng/mL but common when the baseline PSA level is between 2.1 and 3.0 ng/mL (27%) or 3.1 and 4.0 ng/mL (36%). CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that for men with no cancer suspected on digital rectal examination, a PSA level of 4.0 to 5.0 ng/mL is an acceptable range for maintaining the detection of curable prostate cancer and a 2-year PSA testing interval is not likely to miss a curable prostate cancer when the initial PSA level is less than 2.0 ng/mL. Recognizing that 70% of a screened population between the ages of 50 years and 70 years have PSA levels less than 2.0 ng/mL, elimination of annual PSA testing for these men would result in large health care cost savings.	2a
17661855	Does therapeutic touch ease the discomfort or distress of patients undergoing stereotactic core breast biopsy? A randomized clinical trial.	OBJECTIVE: To determine whether therapeutic touch administered at the time of stereotactic core biopsy of suspicious breast lesions results in a reduction in anxiety and pain. DESIGN: Randomized, patient-blinded, controlled trial of either Krieger-Kunz therapeutic touch administered by a trained practitioner or a sham intervention mimicking therapeutic touch delivered during core biopsy. SETTING: Stereotactic breast biopsy unit of a comprehensive breast center. PATIENTS: Women with mammographically detected, nonpalpable breast lesions requiring biopsy. OUTCOME MEASURES: Changes in pain and anxiety measured by visual analog scales immediately before and after stereotactic core biopsy. RESULTS: A total of 82 patients were accrued: 42 received actual therapeutic touch and 40 sham therapeutic touch. No significant differences were found between the arms for age, ethnicity, educational background, or other demographic data. The sham arm had a preponderance of left breast biopsies (48% vs 58%; P = 0.07) and received a slightly higher volume of epinephrine-containing local anesthetic (6.5 +/- 6.1 vs 4.5 +/- 4.5 mL; P = 0.09). Therapeutic touch patients were more likely to have an upper breast lesion location (57% vs 53%; P = 0.022). No significant differences between the arms were seen regarding postbiopsy pain (P = 0.95), anxiety (P = 0.66), fearfulness, or physiological parameters. Similarly, no differences were seen between the arms when change in parameters from prebiopsy to postbiopsy was considered for any of the psychological or physiological variables measured. These findings persisted when confounding variables were controlled for. CONCLUSIONS: Women undergoing stereotactic core breast biopsy received no significant benefit from therapeutic touch administered during the procedure. Therapeutic touch cannot be routinely recommended for patients in this setting.	2b
19418101	The lymph node ratio is the strongest prognostic factor after resection of pancreatic cancer.	INTRODUCTION: Survival after surgery of pancreatic cancer is still poor, even after curative resection. Some prognostic factors like the status of the resection margin, lymph node (LN) status, or tumor grading have been identified. However, only few data have been published regarding the prognostic influence of the LN ratio (number of LN involved to number of examined LN). We, therefore, evaluated potential prognostic factors in 182 patients after resection of pancreatic cancer including assessment of LN ratio. METHODS: Since 1994, 204 patients underwent pancreatic resection for ductal pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Survival was evaluated in 182 patients with complete follow-up evaluations. Of those 182 patients, 88% had cancer of the pancreatic head, 5% of the body, and 7% of the pancreatic tail. Patients underwent pancreatoduodenectomy (85%), distal resection (12%), or total pancreatectomy (3%). Survival was analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier and Cox methods. RESULTS: In all 204 resected patients, operative mortality was 3.9% (n = 8). In the 182 patients with follow-up, 70% had free resection margins, 62% had G1- or G2-classified tumors, and 70% positive LN. Median tumor size was 30 (7-80) mm. The median number of examined LN was 16 and median number of involved LN 1 (range 0-22). Median LN ratio was 0.1 (0-0.79). Cumulative 5-year survival (5-year SV) in all patients was 15%. In univariate analysis, a LN ratio > or = 0.2 (5-year SV 6% vs. 19% with LN ratio < 0.2; p = 0.003), LN ratio > or = 0.3 (5-year SV 0% vs. 18% with LN ratio < 0.3; p < 0.001), a positive resection margin (p < 0.01) and poor differentiation (G3/G4; p < 0.03) were associated with poorer survival. In multivariate analysis, a LN ratio > or = 0.2 (p < 0.02; relative risk RR 1.6), LN ratio > or = 0.3 (p < 0.001; RR 2.2), positive margins (p < 0.02; RR 1.7), and poor differentiation (p < 0.03; RR 1.5) were independent factors predicting a poorer outcome. The conventional nodal status or the number of examined nodes (in all patients and in the subgroups of node positive or negative patients) had no significant influence on survival. Patients with one metastatic LN had the same outcome as patients with negative nodes, but prognosis decreased significantly in patients with two or more LN involved. CONCLUSIONS: Not the lymph node involvement per se but especially the LN ratio is an independent prognostic factor after resection of pancreatic cancers. In our series, the LN ratio was even the strongest predictor of survival. The routine estimation of the LN ratio may be helpful not only for the individual prediction of prognosis but also for the indication of adjuvant therapy and herein related outcome and therapy studies.	2b
27156228	A randomised study comparing the effectiveness of acupuncture or morphine versus the combination for the relief of dyspnoea in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer and mesothelioma.	BACKGROUND: Dyspnoea is one of the commonest symptoms of lung cancer. Opioids can reduce dyspnoea. This study investigates acupuncture for relief of breathlessness in lung cancer. METHODS: We performed a single-centre, randomised phase II study of 173 patients with non-small cell lung cancer or mesothelioma with dyspnoea score of >/=4 on visual analogue scale (VAS). Randomisation was to acupuncture alone (A), morphine alone (M) or both (AM). Acupuncture was administered at upper sternal, thoracic paravertebral, trapezius trigger points and LI4. Manubrial semi-permanent acupuncture studs were inserted and massaged when symptomatic. Arm A patients received rescue morphine. Primary end-point was proportion of patients achieving >/=1.5 improvement in VAS dyspnoea at 4 h. Measurements continued to day 14 and included VAS relaxation, line analogue rating (Lar) anxiety, hospital anxiety and depression and European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer quality-of-life scores. RESULTS: Dyspnoea VAS improved >/=1.5 in 74%, 60% and 66% of arms A, M and AM, respectively, and was maintained in 45% at 2 weeks. There was no statistically significant difference between arms. VAS relaxation improved in arms A (1.06 points) and AM (1.48 points) compared to arm M (-0.19 points, p<0.001). At 7 d, the Lar anxiety score improved in arm A (1.5 points), arm AM (1.2 points) and arm M (no change, p=0.003). Fewer patients received at least one morphine dose in arm A compared with arm M or AM (21% versus 87% versus 87%, respectively, p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: A, M and AM were effective in relieving dyspnoea. Acupuncture relieved anxiety and was morphine sparing, providing an alternative to morphine.	1b
17608870	Increased satisfaction with care and lower costs: results of a randomized trial of in-home palliative care.	OBJECTIVES: To determine whether an in-home palliative care intervention for terminally ill patients can improve patient satisfaction, reduce medical care costs, and increase the proportion of patients dying at home. DESIGN: A randomized, controlled trial. SETTING: Two health maintenance organizations in two states. PARTICIPANTS: Homebound, terminally ill patients (N=298) with a prognosis of approximately 1 year or less to live plus one or more hospital or emergency department visits in the previous 12 months. INTERVENTION: Usual versus in-home palliative care plus usual care delivered by an interdisciplinary team providing pain and symptom relief, patient and family education and training, and an array of medical and social support services. MEASUREMENTS: Measured outcomes were satisfaction with care, use of medical services, site of death, and costs of care. RESULTS: Patients randomized to in-home palliative care reported greater improvement in satisfaction with care at 30 and 90 days after enrollment (P<.05) and were more likely to die at home than those receiving usual care (P<.001). In addition, in-home palliative care subjects were less likely to visit the emergency department (P=.01) or be admitted to the hospital than those receiving usual care (P<.001), resulting in significantly lower costs of care for intervention patients (P=.03). CONCLUSION: In-home palliative care significantly increased patient satisfaction while reducing use of medical services and costs of medical care at the end of life. This study, although modest in scope, presents strong evidence for reforming end-of-life care.	1a
18837657	Robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy: perioperative outcomes of 1500 cases.	BACKGROUND: Robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RALP) is an evolving minimally invasive treatment of for localized prostate cancer. We present our experience of 1500 consecutive cases with an analysis of perioperative outcomes. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifteen hundred consecutive RALPs were performed by a single surgeon (VRP). Following Institutional Review Board approval, clinical coordinators performed prospective intraoperative and postoperative data collection. Functional outcomes were assessed using validated self-administered questionnaires. RESULTS: Mean OR time from skin incision to fascial closure (the time that the surgeon was present) was 105 minutes (55-300). Mean EBL was 111 cc (50-500). Ninety-seven percent of patients were discharged home on postoperative day 1. The overall complication rate was 4.3% with no mortalities. The positive margin rate (PMR) was 9.3% overall. PMR was 4% for pT2, 34% for T3 and 40% for pathologic stage T4. CONCLUSIONS: Our initial series represents one of the largest published series for perioperative outcomes of robotic assisted prostatectomy. Our data demonstrates the feasibility, safety and efficacy of the procedure.	3a
25891173	Pembrolizumab versus Ipilimumab in Advanced Melanoma.	BACKGROUND: The immune checkpoint inhibitor ipilimumab is the standard-of-care treatment for patients with advanced melanoma. Pembrolizumab inhibits the programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) immune checkpoint and has antitumor activity in patients with advanced melanoma. METHODS: In this randomized, controlled, phase 3 study, we assigned 834 patients with advanced melanoma in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive pembrolizumab (at a dose of 10 mg per kilogram of body weight) every 2 weeks or every 3 weeks or four doses of ipilimumab (at 3 mg per kilogram) every 3 weeks. Primary end points were progression-free and overall survival. RESULTS: The estimated 6-month progression-free-survival rates were 47.3% for pembrolizumab every 2 weeks, 46.4% for pembrolizumab every 3 weeks, and 26.5% for ipilimumab (hazard ratio for disease progression, 0.58; P<0.001 for both pembrolizumab regimens versus ipilimumab; 95% confidence intervals [CIs], 0.46 to 0.72 and 0.47 to 0.72, respectively). Estimated 12-month survival rates were 74.1%, 68.4%, and 58.2%, respectively (hazard ratio for death for pembrolizumab every 2 weeks, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.47 to 0.83; P=0.0005; hazard ratio for pembrolizumab every 3 weeks, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.52 to 0.90; P=0.0036). The response rate was improved with pembrolizumab administered every 2 weeks (33.7%) and every 3 weeks (32.9%), as compared with ipilimumab (11.9%) (P<0.001 for both comparisons). Responses were ongoing in 89.4%, 96.7%, and 87.9% of patients, respectively, after a median follow-up of 7.9 months. Efficacy was similar in the two pembrolizumab groups. Rates of treatment-related adverse events of grade 3 to 5 severity were lower in the pembrolizumab groups (13.3% and 10.1%) than in the ipilimumab group (19.9%). CONCLUSIONS: The anti-PD-1 antibody pembrolizumab prolonged progression-free survival and overall survival and had less high-grade toxicity than did ipilimumab in patients with advanced melanoma.

12035046	Long-term survival in 2,505 patients with melanoma with regional lymph node metastasis.	OBJECTIVE: To examine the long-term outcomes of patients with melanoma metastatic to regional lymph nodes. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Regional lymph node metastasis is a major determinant of outcome for patients with melanoma, and the presence of regional lymph node metastasis has been commonly used as an indication for systemic, often intensive, adjuvant therapy. However, the risk of recurrence varies greatly within this heterogeneous group of patients. METHODS: Database review identified 2,505 patients, referred to the Duke University Melanoma Clinic between 1970 and 1998, with histologic confirmation of regional lymph node metastasis before clinical evidence of distant metastasis and with documentation of full lymph node dissection. Recurrence and survival after lymph node dissection were analyzed. RESULTS: Estimated overall survival rates at 5, 10, 15, and 20 years were 43%, 35%, 28%, and 23%, respectively. This population included 792 actual 5-year survivors, 350 10-year survivors, and 137 15-year survivors. The number of positive lymph nodes was the most powerful predictor of both overall survival and recurrence-free survival; 5-year overall survival rates ranged from 53% for one positive node to 25% for greater than four nodes. Primary tumor ulceration and thickness were also powerful predictors of both overall and recurrence-free survival in multivariate analyses. The most common site of first recurrence after lymph node dissection was distant (44% of all patients). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with regional lymph node metastasis can enjoy significant long-term survival after lymph node dissection. Therefore, aggressive surgical therapy of regional lymph node metastases is warranted, and each individual's risk of recurrence should be weighed against the potential risks of adjuvant therapy.	3b
25373320	Intravenous iron alone resolves anemia in patients with functional iron deficiency and lymphoid malignancies undergoing chemotherapy.	This randomized trial evaluated ferric carboxymaltose without erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESA) for correction of anemia in cancer patients with functional iron deficiency. Patients on treatment for indolent lymphoid malignancies, who had anemia [hemoglobin (Hb) 8.5-10.5 g/dL] and functional iron deficiency [transferrin saturation (TSAT) </= 20%, ferritin >30 ng/mL (women) or >40 ng/mL (men)], were randomized to ferric carboxymaltose (1,000 mg iron) or control. Primary end point was the mean change in Hb from baseline to weeks 4, 6 and 8 without transfusions or ESA. Difficulties with patient recruitment led to premature termination of the study. Seventeen patients (8 ferric carboxymaltose and 9 control) were included in the analysis. In the ferric carboxymaltose arm, mean Hb increase was significantly higher versus control at week 8 (p = 0.021). All ferric carboxymaltose-treated patients achieved an Hb increase >1 g/dL (control 6/9; p = 0.087), and mean TSAT was >20% from week 2 onwards. No treatment-related adverse events were reported. In conclusion, ferric carboxymaltose without ESA effectively increased Hb and iron status in this small patient population.	2b
21811356	Palliative management of malignant bowel obstruction in terminally ill patient.	Mr. P was a 57-year-old man who presented with symptoms of bowel obstruction in the setting of a known metastatic pancreatic cancer. Diagnosis of malignant bowel obstruction was made clinically and radiologically and he was treated conservatively (non-operatively)with octreotide, metoclopromide and dexamethasone, which provided good control over symptoms and allowed him to have quality time with family until he died few weeks later with liver failure. Bowel obstruction in patients with abdominal malignancy requires careful assessment. The patient and family should always be involved in decision making. The ultimate goals of palliative care (symptom management, quality of life and dignity of death) should never be forgotten during decision making for any patient.	3a
10799173	Quality of life of asymptomatic men with nonmetastatic prostate cancer on androgen deprivation therapy.	PURPOSE: We evaluate the quality of life of asymptomatic men with nonmetastatic prostate cancer who receive androgen deprivation therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Quality of life was longitudinally evaluated in a cohort of 144 men with locally advanced prostate cancer or prostate specific antigen relapse after local therapy who chose to receive (79 patients) or not to receive (65 patients) androgen deprivation therapy. Androgen deprivation therapy consisted of orchiectomy, leuprolide alone or leuprolide plus flutamide. Multivariate analysis of variance was used to test the effect of different treatment regimens on patient quality of life. RESULTS: Men who received androgen suppression had more fatigue, loss of energy, emotional distress and a lower overall quality of life than men who deferred hormone therapy. Combined androgen blockade had a greater adverse effect on quality of life than monotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Androgen deprivation therapy may significantly impair the physical and emotional health of asymptomatic patients with nonmetastatic prostate cancer.	2a
16498100	Conventional MRI capabilities in the diagnosis of prostate cancer in the transition zone.	OBJECTIVES: Our objectives were to evaluate the diagnostic capabilities of conventional MRI for the accurate detection of prostate cancer within the transition zone and to compare the results with histopathologic examination results. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred sixteen prostate specimens with prostate cancer were consecutively obtained. Axial, sagittal, and coronal T2- and T1-weighted MR images with gadopentetate dimeglumine were independently reviewed by two radiologists. The diagnostic base criteria of the MR images were determined for detecting transition zone cancer as follows: lesions with A, uniform low intensity on T2-weighted images; B, homogeneous gadolinium enhancement; and C, irregular margins both on gadolinium-enhanced and T2-weighted images. Wilcoxon's rank sum and chi-square tests and receiver operating characteristic curves were used. Differences of less than 0.05 were considered significant. RESULTS: Eighty-six lesions in the transition zone were analyzed. Histopathologic analysis showed 53 cancers and 33 benign lesions. The diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for cancer were 50%, 51%, and 51%, respectively with criteria A; 68%, 75%, and 71% with criteria B; and 60%, 72%, and 65% with criteria C. When base criteria were combined into criteria A-B, A-C, and B-C and then further divided into three subgroups, accuracy was found to be highest when the lesion satisfied any two criteria from A, B, and C than those of base criteria, combination criteria, and the other two subgroups. CONCLUSION: The addition of gadolinium-enhanced MRI to T2-weighted imaging provides better accuracy for detecting cancerous transition zone lesions than the use of T2-weighted imaging alone.	2a
9484942	Postoperative accelerated radiotherapy in high-risk squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck: long-term results of a prospective trial.	"BACKGROUND: For patients treated with combination resection and postoperative radiotherapy, the interval between surgery and completion of radiotherapy represents an opportunity for tumor repopulation and treatment failure. A prospective trial to test the feasibility and efficacy of accelerated postoperative radiotherapy was concluded in August of 1990. METHODS: Thirty-two patients with high-risk pathologic findings were treated with 63 Gy in 35 fractions of 1.8 Gy over 5.2 weeks using a modified concomitant-boost technique. RESULTS: Acute mucosal and skin reactions were increased but tolerable. At a median follow-up of 6 years, the crude in-field recurrence rate for the entire group was 10/32 (31%), with 0/10 (0%) recurrences in patients commencing accelerated radiotherapy within 4 weeks of surgery and 10/22 (45%) recurrences in patients with a delay of more than 4 weeks (p = .006). The rate of late complications appears similar to that seen with conventional radiotherapy, with possibly a higher rate of ""consequential""-type late effects. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study suggests that prompt application of accelerated postoperative radiotherapy significantly improves local-regional control and supports the concept of rapid tumor repopulation in the postoperative setting. Various strategies to overcome tumor repopulation are discussed."	4
9490097	S-100 and NSE as serum markers in melanoma.	S-100 protein and neuron-specific enolase (NSE) have recently been proposed as serum markers for melanoma. In this study NSE and S-100 serum levels were assayed by commercial IRMA methods in 53 patients with melanoma. The overall prevalence of abnormal marker levels was similar for NSE (26%) and S-100 (30%). The 24 patients in stages I and II had uniformly normal S-100 levels, but abnormal NSE levels were observed in 3 out of the 12 patients in stage II (33%) and in 1 out of 12 in stage I. NSE appears thus to be the marker of choice in the early stages, where its increase points to disease progression. In patients in stages III and IV the prevalence of abnormal values was 34% for NSE and 55% for S-100 (p = < 0.05). In the latter group diagnostic sensitivity increased to 62% if isolated elevation of each marker was considered. In patients with advanced stage disease, both NSE and S-100 should be assayed.	3b
23335153	Reducing the psychological distress of family caregivers of home-based palliative care patients: short-term effects from a randomised controlled trial.	BACKGROUND: Palliative care is expected to incorporate comprehensive support for family caregivers given that many caregivers suffer psychological morbidity. However, systematically implemented evidence-based psychological support initiatives are lacking. AIM: The objective of this study was to prepare caregivers for the role of supporting a patient with advanced cancer receiving home-based palliative care by offering a one-to-one psycho-educational intervention. We hypothesised that primary family caregivers who participated in the intervention would report decreased psychological distress (primary outcome), fewer unmet needs and increased levels of perceived preparedness, competence and positive emotions. METHODS: A three-arm randomised controlled trial was conducted comparing two versions of the intervention (one face-to-face visit versus two visits) plus standard care to a control group (standard care) across four sites in Australia. RESULTS: A total of 298 participants were recruited; 148 were in the Control condition, 57 in Intervention 1 (one visit) and 93 in Intervention 2 (two visits). Relative to participants in the control group; the psychological well-being of participants in the intervention condition was improved by a small amount but non-significantly. No significant reduction in unmet needs or improvements in positive aspects of caregiving amongst the intervention group were identified. However, the intervention demonstrated significant improvements in participants' levels of preparedness and competence for Intervention 2. CONCLUSION/IMPLICATIONS: This research adds to accumulating body of evidence demonstrating that relatively short psycho-educational interventions can enable family caregivers to feel more prepared and competent in the role of supporting a dying relative. Further investigation is required to determine the longer term outcomes of such interventions.	1b
18925403	Evaluation of T2-weighted and dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI in localizing prostate cancer before repeat biopsy.	We assessed the accuracy of T2-weighted (T2w) and dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) 1.5-T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in localizing prostate cancer before transrectal ultrasound-guided repeat biopsy. Ninety-three patients with abnormal PSA level and negative prostate biopsy underwent T2w and DCE prostate MRI using pelvic coil before repeat biopsy. T2w and DCE images were interpreted using visual criteria only. MR results were correlated with repeat biopsy findings in ten prostate sectors. Repeat biopsy found prostate cancer in 23 patients (24.7%) and 44 sectors (6.6%). At per patient analysis, the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values were 47.8%, 44.3%, 20.4% and 79.5% for T2w imaging and 82.6%, 20%, 24.4% and 93.3% for DCE imaging. When all suspicious areas (on T2w or DCE imaging) were taken into account, a sensitivity of 82.6% and a negative predictive value of 100% could be achieved. At per sector analysis, DCE imaging was significantly less specific (83.5% vs. 89.7%, p < 0.002) than T2w imaging; it was more sensitive (52.4% vs. 32.1%), but the difference was hardly significant (p = 0.09). T2w and DCE MRI using pelvic coil and visual diagnostic criteria can guide prostate repeat biopsy, with a good sensitivity and NPV.	3a
16700037	Radical prostatectomy for clinical T4 prostate cancer.	BACKGROUND: Occasionally, patients with clinical T4 (cT4) prostate cancer undergo surgery. Published data on outcomes after radical prostatectomy (RP) in patients with such advanced stage disease and on the impact of adjuvant radiation therapy (RT) and hormone therapy (HT) are nonexistent. METHODS: Data from the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) data base were reviewed for the 7-year period from 1995 to 2001. Specifically, data were analyzed for 1093 patients with cT4, lymph node-negative or lymph node-positive, M0 prostate cancer without distant lymph node involvement or a history of other cancer. Using follow-up data through 2002, postdiagnosis survival was examined in 5 treatment groups: radical prostatectomy (RP) either alone or in combination with other therapy, radiation therapy (RT) alone, hormone therapy (HT) alone, RT plus HT, and no treatment (NT). All results were expressed as 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year observed survival and corresponding relative survival. Mortality across treatment categories was compared by using a Cox proportionate hazards model controlling for age, year of diagnosis, race, tumor grade, regional lymph node involvement, clinical tumor extension, and SEER registry. RESULTS: Observed and relative survival rates were lowest among patients who received NT and highest among patients who underwent RP. Adding adjuvant RT or HT to RP conferred no survival benefit. Multivariate survival analyses revealed a significant increase in mortality among HT-only patients and among patients who received NT compared with patients who underwent RP. The differences in survival among treatment types were most pronounced in a relatively small group of patients who had positive regional lymph node extension. In all other patients, the results suggested a modest (but not significant) improvement in survival after RT plus HT. CONCLUSIONS: SEER data revealed that patients who underwent RP for cT4 prostate cancer had increased survival compared with patients who received RT alone or HT alone and had a survival comparable to that of patients who received RT plus HT. The benefit of RP appears to be limited to a relatively small subset of patients who have regional lymph node extension.	2a
27482166	EFFECT OF THERAPEUTIC TOUCH ON PAIN RELATED PARAMETERS IN PATIENTS WITH CANCER: A RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIAL.	INTRODUCTION: In patients with cancer, pain may influence their life style, and feeling of satisfaction and comfort, leading to fatigue, and cause impairment of their quality of life, personal relationships, sleep and daily activities. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of therapeutic touch (TT) on pain related parameters of in patients with cancer. METHODS: In a randomized clinical trial a total of 90 male patients referring to Specialized Oncology Hospital in Mashhad, were conveniently selected and randomly divided into three intervention, placebo, and control groups. The intervention consisted of TT in 7 sessions for a 4-week period. The data were collected using a demographic questionnaire along with the Brief Pain Inventory, which were then analyzed and compared using Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests. RESULTS: By comparing scores parameters of pain scales (general activity, mood, walking ability, relations with other people and sleep) in the three groups, there was no significant difference at the beginning of the first session. However, a significant difference was observed at the end of TT sessions between the three groups (p= 0.001). Furthermore, the groups were compared two-by-two by using Mann-Whitney test and Bonferroni correction, and the result indicated significant differences between the two intervention and placebo groups as well as between the two intervention and control groups. CONCLUSION: The results of the study showed that TT had a positive impact on the positive management of pain related parameters in cancer patients. Therefore, TT is suggested to be used by healthcare providers as a complementary method for managing pain and its parameters.	2b
8416544	Data on first recurrence after treatment for malignant melanoma in a large patient population.	Recurrent malignant melanoma is a clinical entity that behaves distinctly differently from the primary disease. The purpose of this study was to determine whether there are significant trends in the prognostic factors or in the timing and sites of recurrence. We reviewed 250 patients with recurrent malignant melanoma from the Sydney Melanoma Unit in Australia who were followed in their Tumor Registry between 1960 and 1981 (median follow-up was 7 years). Fifty-two percent of all first recurrences were to regional nodes, 17 percent were local recurrences, 8 percent were in-transit metastases, and 23 percent of all first recurrences were to a distant organ. We found that 67 percent of all recurrences were diagnosed within 24 months and 81 percent were diagnosed by 36 months after the primary melanoma. Regional nodal recurrences were diagnosed earlier (with 63 percent at 18 months and 74 percent at 24 months). Local recurrences and in-transit metastases were comparable (with 55 percent of each at 18 months and about 66 percent of each at 24 months), and systemic recurrences were diagnosed later (52 percent at 24 months and 71 percent at 36 months). Of significant interest was the fact that survival after the diagnosis of recurrence was independent of thickness of the primary tumor or duration of disease-free interval (local, in-transit, or regional nodal). Only the diagnosis of distant organ metastasis correlated with shorter survival; local recurrence, in-transit metastasis, and regional nodal metastasis were all associated with comparable survivals.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)	2b
12752285	Radical lymph node dissection for melanoma.	BACKGROUND: Therapeutic lymph node dissection for melanoma aims to achieve regional disease control. Radical lymphadenectomy (RLND) can be a difficult procedure associated with significant postoperative morbidity. The aims of the present study were to review regional disease control and morbidity in a series of lymphadenectomies performed within a specialist unit. METHODS: The present study involved the analysis of 73 lymphadenectomies in 64 patients, from 1995 to 2001. RESULTS: The overall wound complication rate after inguinal lymphadenectomy (71%) was higher than after axillary lymphadenectomy (47%; P = 0.05). After inguinal lymphadenectomy, the wound infection rate was higher (25.0%vs 5.9%; P = 0.03), delayed wound healing was more frequent (25.0%vs 5.9%; P = 0.03), and the mean time that drain tubes remained in situ was longer (12.5 vs 8.2 days; P = 0.05). There were no significant differences in seroma (46%vs 32%) rates. Lymphoedema was more common after inguinal lymphadenectomy (P < 0.02). Multivariate analysis identified inguinal RLND (P = 0.002) and increasing tumour size (P = 0.045) as predictors of wound morbidity. More patients received postoperative radiotherapy after neck RLND compared to inguinal or axilla RLND (P = 0.03). Six (8%) patients developed local recurrence after lymphadenectomy. At a median follow up of 22 months, 34 (53%) patients have died, from disseminated disease. CONCLUSIONS: Radical lymphadenectomy for melanoma is associated with significant morbidity. Inguinal node dissection has a higher rate of complications than axillary dissection. Low local recurrence rates can be achieved, limiting the potential morbidity of uncontrolled regional metastatic disease.	3b
28253845	Impact of a combined multimodal-aerobic and multimodal intervention compared to standard aerobic treatment in breast cancer survivors with chronic cancer-related fatigue - results of a three-armed pragmatic trial in a comprehensive cohort design.	BACKGROUND: Cancer-related fatigue (CRF) and insomnia are major complaints in breast cancer survivors (BC). Aerobic training (AT), the standard therapy for CRF in BC, shows only minor to moderate treatment effects. Other evidence-based treatments include cognitive behavioral therapy, e.g., sleep education/restriction (SE) and mindfulness-based therapies. We investigated the effectiveness of a 10-week multimodal program (MT) consisting of SE, psycho-education, eurythmy- and painting-therapy, administered separately or in combination with AT (CT) and compared both arms to AT alone. METHODS: In a pragmatic comprehensive cohort study BC with chronic CRF were allocated randomly or by patient preference to (a) MT, (b) CT (MT + AT) or (c) AT alone. Primary endpoint was a composite score of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and the Cancer Fatigue Scale after 10 weeks of intervention (T1); a second endpoint was a follow-up assessment 6 months later (T2). The primary hypothesis stated superiority of CT and non-inferiority of MT vs. AT at T1. A closed testing procedure preserved the global alpha-level. The intention-to-treat analysis included propensity scores for the mode of allocation and for the preferred treatment, respectively. RESULTS: Altogether 126 BC were recruited: 65 were randomized and 61 allocated by preference; 105 started the intervention. Socio-demographic parameters were generally balanced at baseline. Non-inferiority of MT to AT at T1 was confirmed (p < 0.05), yet the confirmative analysis stopped as it was not possible to confirm superiority of CT vs. AT (p = 0.119). In consecutive exploratory analyses MT and CT were superior to AT at T1 and T2 (MT) or T2 alone (CT), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The multimodal CRF-therapy was found to be confirmatively non-inferior to standard therapy and even yielded exploratively sustained superiority. A randomized controlled trial including a larger sample size and a longer follow-up to evaluate multimodal CRF-therapy is highly warranted. TRIAL REGISTER: DRKS-ID: DRKS00003736 .

19744432	Prognostic implications of tumor invasion or adhesion to peripancreatic vessels in resected pancreatic cancer.	"BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the operative risk and the prognostic implications of pancreatectomy plus resection and reconstruction of peripancreatic vessels (PPV) in patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma. METHODS: One hundred ten patients who underwent pancreatectomy with PPV resection and reconstruction (Study Group; SG) were retrospectively compared with 62 patients without distant metastasis who were palliated, (Control Group 1; CG-1), as well as 197 patients who underwent ""conventional""pancreatectomy (Control Group 2; CG-2). RESULTS: Postoperative morbidity and mortality were similar in SG (33% and 3%), in CG-1 (26% and 3%), and in CG-2 (40% and 6%) patients. Median survival time (MST) of SG patients (15 months) was longer than that of CG-1 patients (6 months; P < .0001) and similar to that of CG-2 patients (18 months). Patients undergoing isolated venous resection (n = 84) had the best outcome (MST: 15 months) ( P < .0001 vs CG-1 patients), while patients undergoing resection of multiple PPV (n = 14) had the worst outcome (MST: 8 months). PPV infiltration, histologically proven in 64 patients (65%), was associated with decreased MST only if the tunica intima was infiltrated (26%) (11 months; P < .001). Multivariate analysis showed that no adjuvant therapy, intimal invasion, and poorly differentiated histology were associated with a higher hazard of death by 2.2, 2.2, and 2.5-fold, respectively. CONCLUSION: In properly selected patients, pancreatectomy plus resection and reconstruction of PPV was performed as safely as palliation or ""conventional"" pancreatectomy and was associated with better survival when compared to palliation."	2b
6505267	External beam radiotherapy in cancer of the prostate. The University of Arizona experience.	Between 1973 and 1979, 218 patients with adenocarcinoma of the prostate stage A2 through D1 were treated with primary external beam radiotherapy. The majority of the patients (211) received 6000-7000 rad to the prostate using a small (160) or large (58) volume technique. With a minimum follow-up of 36 months and a maximum of 120 months, the control rates of the local tumor were 96%, 95%, 88% and 81% for stage A2, B, C and D1. The corresponding 5-year survivals were 100%, 82%, 60% and 42%. Mild to severe complications were documented in 35 cases (16%). The frequency and severity of the complications correlated with the size of the irradiated volume and history of previous surgery. The use of large fields, to encompass the regional lymphatics, is not associated with improved survival.	2a
18930488	The prognostic impact of seminal vesicle involvement found at prostatectomy and the effects of adjuvant radiation: data from Southwest Oncology Group 8794.	PURPOSE: From the randomized study Southwest Oncology Group 8794 we evaluated the effect of seminal vesicle involvement on outcomes and whether those patients benefited from post-prostatectomy adjuvant radiation therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Southwest Oncology Group study 8794 randomized high risk patients (with seminal vesicle positive disease and/or capsular penetration and/or positive margins) to radiation vs observation after prostatectomy. A total of 431 subjects with pathologically advanced prostate cancer were randomized. RESULTS: Median followup was 12.2 years. Of the patients 139 had seminal vesicle involvement with or without capsular penetration and/or positive margins. Compared to the 286 patients with seminal vesicle negative disease there was poorer 10-year biochemical failure-free survival (33% for seminal vesicle negative and 22% for seminal vesicle positive, p = 0.04), metastasis-free survival (70% and 56%, respectively, p = 0.005) and overall survival (10-year overall survival 74% and 61%, respectively, p = 0.02) for those with seminal vesicle positive disease. Patients with seminal vesicle positive disease who received adjuvant radiation compared to observation realized an improvement in 10-year biochemical failure-free survival from 12% to 36% (p = 0.001), in 10-year overall survival from 51% to 71% (p = 0.08) and in metastasis-free survival from 47% to 66% (p = 0.09), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Although seminal vesicle involvement is a negative prognostic factor, long-term control is possible especially if patients are given adjuvant radiation therapy. This therapy appears to be effective in patients with seminal vesicle involvement.	1a
24313958	Acneiform eruptions: a common cutaneous toxicity of the MEK inhibitor trametinib.	BACKGROUND: The MEK inhibitor trametinib is currently undergoing clinical trials as the treatment of metastatic melanoma both alone and in combination with the BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib. One of the most frequent side-effects associated with its use as a single agent is the development of acneiform eruptions. These eruptions seem to be reduced when dosed in combination with dabrafenib. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the prevalence of acneiform eruptions in patients taking the MEK inhibitor trametinib, both alone and in combination with dabrafenib. METHODS: All patients enrolled in the trametinib alone (n = 13) or trametinib and dabrafenib combination (n = 30) clinical trials at a single site underwent a retrospective file review. The development and management of acne or acneiform eruptions was noted. RESULTS: In total, 77% of the trametinib group developed an acneiform eruption on the trial, while only 10% developed acneiform lesions in the combination trial. The patients were treated with oral doxycycline, topical antibiotics or topical antiseptic washes, with a good response. However the condition recurred if these treatments were ceased and the patient was still on trametinib therapy. CONCLUSIONS: The MEK inhibitor trametinib is associated with the development of acneiform eruptions. When combined with dabrafenib the frequency of this side-effect is reduced.	3a
12218228	Imiquimod, a topical immune response modifier, in the treatment of cutaneous metastases of malignant melanoma.	BACKGROUND: Imiquimod 5% cream (Aldara, a novel topical immune response modifier, has been approved for the topical treatment of anogenital HPV-induced warts. In addition, several studies have demonstrated antitumoral activity in solar keratoses, superficial basal cell carcinomas and Bowen's disease. AIM: Given the convincing therapeutic results of imiquimod when used for treating selected types of epithelial skin cancer, we became interested to study imiquimod as an adjuvant for treating cutaneous metastases of malignant melanoma. METHODS: Three patients with multiple, i.e. more than 15, cutaneous in-transit metastases of malignant melanoma in unilateral localization on the leg were treated topically with imiquimod 5% cream. RESULTS: Twice daily application under occlusive conditions for a period of 21-28 weeks resulted in >90% regression of cutaneous metastases in 2 patients. The third patient showed marked response only when topical imiquimod was intermittently supplemented by intralesional interleukin (IL)-2 for 2 weeks. Unwanted side effects were mild in all patients. CONCLUSION: Overall, imiquimod as a single agent or in combination with intralesional IL-2 may be a promising immunomodulatory compound for the adjuvant topical treatment of patients with multiple cutaneous metastases of malignant melanoma.	4
21306953	Axitinib plus gemcitabine versus placebo plus gemcitabine in patients with advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma: a double-blind randomised phase 3 study.	BACKGROUND: Axitinib is a potent, selective inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptors 1, 2, and 3. A randomised phase 2 trial of gemcitabine with or without axitinib in advanced pancreatic cancer suggested increased overall survival in axitinib-treated patients. On the basis of these results, we aimed to assess the effect of treatment with gemcitabine plus axitinib on overall survival in a phase 3 trial. METHODS: In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 study, eligible patients had metastatic or locally advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma, no uncontrolled hypertension or venous thrombosis, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0 or 1. Patients, stratified by disease extent (metastatic vs locally advanced), were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive gemcitabine 1000 mg/m(2) intravenously on days 1, 8, and 15 every 28 days plus either axitinib or placebo. Axitinib or placebo were administered orally with food at a starting dose of 5 mg twice a day, which could be dose-titrated up to 10 mg twice daily if well tolerated. A centralised randomisation procedure was used to assign patients to each treatment group, with randomised permuted blocks within strata. Patients, investigators, and the trial sponsor were masked to treatment assignments. The primary endpoint was overall survival. All efficacy analyses were done in all patients assigned to treatment groups for whom data were available; safety and treatment administration and compliance assessments were based on treatment received. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00471146. FINDINGS: Between July 27, 2007, and Oct 31, 2008, 632 patients were enrolled and assigned to treatment groups (316 axitinib, 316 placebo). At an interim analysis in January, 2009, the independent data monitoring committee concluded that the futility boundary had been crossed. Median overall survival was 8.5 months (95% CI 6.9-9.5) for gemcitabine plus axitinib (n=314, data missing for two patients) and 8.3 months (6.9-10.3) for gemcitabine plus placebo (n=316; hazard ratio 1.014, 95% CI 0.786-1.309; one-sided p=0.5436). The most common grade 3 or higher adverse events for gemcitabine plus axitinib and gemcitabine plus placebo were hypertension (20 [7%] and 5 [2%] events, respectively), abdominal pain (20 [7%] and 17 [6%]), fatigue (27 [9%] and 21 [7%]), and anorexia (19 [6%] and 11 [4%]). INTERPRETATION: The addition of axitinib to gemcitabine does not improve overall survival in advanced pancreatic cancer. These results add to increasing evidence that targeting of VEGF signalling is an ineffective strategy in this disease. FUNDING: Pfizer.	1b
19917860	Clinical results of long-term follow-up of a large, active surveillance cohort with localized prostate cancer.	PURPOSE We assessed the outcome of a watchful-waiting protocol with selective delayed intervention by using clinical prostate-specific antigen (PSA), or histologic progression as treatment indications for clinically localized prostate cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS This was a prospective, single-arm, cohort study. Patients were managed with an initial expectant approach. Definitive intervention was offered to those patients with a PSA doubling time of less than 3 years, Gleason score progression (to 4 + 3 or greater), or unequivocal clinical progression. Survival analysis and Cox proportional hazard model were applied to the data. Results A total of 450 patients have been observed with active surveillance. Median follow-up was 6.8 years (range, 1 to 13 years). Overall survival was 78.6%. The 10-year prostate cancer actuarial survival was 97.2%. Overall, 30% of patients have been reclassified as higher risk and have been offered definitive therapy. Of 117 patients treated radically, the PSA failure rate was 50%, which was 13% of the total cohort. PSA doubling time of 3 years or less was associated with an 8.5-times higher risk of biochemical failure after definitive treatment compared with a doubling time of more than 3 years (P < .0001). The hazard ratio for nonprostate cancer to prostate cancer mortality was 18.6 at 10 years. CONCLUSION We observed a low rate of prostate cancer mortality. Among the patients who were reclassified as higher risk and who were treated, PSA failure was relatively common. Other-cause mortality accounted for almost all of the deaths. Additional studies are warranted to improve the identification of patients who harbor more aggressive disease despite favorable clinical parameters at diagnosis.	3a
27084345	Neurological, respiratory, musculoskeletal, cardiac and ocular side-effects of anti-PD-1 therapy.	BACKGROUND: Anti-programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) antibodies represent an effective treatment option for metastatic melanoma and other cancer entities. They act via blockade of the PD-1 receptor, an inhibitor of the T-cell effector mechanisms that limit immune responses against tumours. As reported for ipilimumab, the anti-PD-1 antibodies pembrolizumab and nivolumab can induce immune-related adverse events (irAEs). These side-effects can involve skin, gastrointestinal tract, liver, the endocrine system and other organ systems. Since life-threatening and fatal irAEs have been reported, adequate diagnosis and management are essential. METHODS AND FINDINGS: In total, 496 patients with metastatic melanoma from 15 skin cancer centres were treated with pembrolizumab or nivolumab. Two hundred forty two side-effects in 138 patients have been analysed. In 77 of the 138 patients side-effects affected the nervous system, respiratory tract, musculoskeletal system, heart, blood and eyes. Not yet reported side-effects such as meningo-(radiculitis), polyradiculitis, cardiac arrhythmia, asystolia, and paresis have been observed. Rare and difficult to manage side-effects such as myasthenia gravis are described in detail. CONCLUSION: Anti-PD-1 antibodies can induce a plethora of irAEs. The knowledge of them will allow prompt diagnosis and improve the management resulting in decreased morbidity.	3a
17462460	Prognostic relevance of lymph node ratio following pancreaticoduodenectomy for pancreatic cancer.	BACKGROUND: The presence or absence of lymph node metastases is known to be an important prognostic factor for patients with pancreatic cancer. Few studies have investigated the ratio of the number of lymph nodes harboring metastatic cancer to the total number of lymph nodes examined (lymph node ratio [LNR]) with regard to outcome after pancreaticoduodenectomy for ductal cancer of the pancreas. METHODS: Between 1995 and 2005, a total of 905 patients underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy for pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Demographics, operative data, number of lymph nodes evaluated, number of lymph nodes with metastatic carcinoma, LNR, pathologic margin status, and long-term survival were analyzed. RESULTS: There were 187 (20.7%) of the 905 patients who had negative peripancreatic lymph nodes (N0), whereas 718 (79.3%) of the 905 patients had lymph node metastases (N1). The median number of lymph nodes evaluated in the N0 group was 15 versus 18 in the N1 group (P = .12). At median follow-up of 24 months, the median survival for all patients was 17.4 months, and the 5-year actuarial survival rate was 16.1%. Patients with lymph node metastases had a shorter median overall survival (16.5 months) compared with patients with negative lymph nodes (25.3 months; P = .001). Compared with the total number of lymph nodes examined or total number of lymph node metastases, LNR was the most compelling predictor of survival. As the LNR increased, median overall survival decreased (LNR = 0, 25.3 months; LNR > 0 to 0.2, 21.7 months; LNR > 0.2 to 0.4, 15.3 months; LNR > 0.4, 12.2 months; P = .001). After adjusting for other factors associated with survival, LNR remained an independent predictor of overall survival (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: After pancreaticoduodenectomy for adenocarcinoma of the pancreas, LNR was one of the most powerful predictors of survival. LNR should be considered when stratifying patients in future clinical trials.	2b
22018935	A diet, physical activity, and stress reduction intervention in men with rising prostate-specific antigen after treatment for prostate cancer.	BACKGROUND: Nearly 35% of men treated for prostate cancer (PrCA) will experience biochemically defined recurrence, noted by a rise in PSA, within 10 years of definitive therapy. Diet, physical activity, and stress reduction may affect tumor promotion and disease progression. METHODS: A randomized trial of an intensive diet, physical activity, and meditation intervention was conducted in men with rising post-treatment PSA after definitive treatment for PrCA. Intention-to-treat methods were used to compare usual care to the intervention in 47 men with complete data. Signal detection methods were used to identify dietary factors associated with PSA change. RESULTS: The intervention and control groups did not differ statistically on any demographic or disease-related factor. Although the intervention group experienced decreases of 39% in intakes of saturated fatty acid (SFA as percent of total calories) (p<0.0001) and 12% in total energy intake (218 kcal/day, p<0.05)], no difference in PSA change was observed by intervention status. Signal detection methods indicated that in men increasing their consumption of fruit, 56% experienced no rise in PSA (vs. 29% in men who did not increase their fruit intake). Among men who increased fruit and fiber intakes, PSA increased in 83% of participants who also increased saturated fatty acid intake (vs. 44% in participants who decreased or maintained saturated fatty acid intake). CONCLUSION: Results are discussed in the context of conventional treatment strategies that were more aggressive when this study was being conducted in the mid-2000s. Positive health changes in a number of lifestyle parameters were observed with the intervention, and both increased fruit and reduced saturated fat intakes were associated with maintaining PSA levels in men with biochemically recurrent disease.	2b
22617251	Sentinel node status predicts survival in thick melanomas: the Oxford perspective.	AIMS: To determine the prognostic value of SLNB in patients with thick melanoma in terms of overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS). METHODS: 136 patients with primary tumours (Breslow thickness >/= 4.0 mm) underwent SLNB. OS and RFS were calculated and a multivariate Cox regression model used to determine the important prognostic factors for predicting OS and RFS. RESULTS: Median Breslow thickness was 5.5 mm and 60% were ulcerated. Median follow up was 4 years (95% CI = 4-5) with 54 patients having died at the time of analysis. 5-year OS for SLNB positive patients was 32%, compared to 78% for negative patients. The significant predictors of poorer OS were increasing age (p = 0.03), increasing Breslow thickness (p = 0.03) and SLNB positivity (p < 0.0001). 5 year RFS was significantly worse in the SLNB positive population compared to the negative patients (p < 0.0001); 27% versus 66% respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with a thick melanoma and a positive SLNB have a significantly worse RFS and OS compared to those with a negative SLNB. Over three-quarters of patients with a negative SLNB survived five years. These findings have implications for the subpopulations included in adjuvant therapy trials and we advocate SLNB be recommended in patients with thick melanomas.	3a
22276129	Prognosis of sentinel node staged patients with primary cutaneous melanoma.	BACKGROUND: This study investigated survival probabilities and prognostic factors in sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) staged patients with cutaneous melanoma (CM) with the aim of defining subgroups of patients who are at higher risk for recurrences and who should be considered for adjuvant clinical trials. METHODS: Patients with primary CM who underwent SLNB in the Department of Dermatology, University of Tuebingen, Germany, between 1996 and 2009 were included into this study. Survival probabilities and prognostic factors were evaluated by Kaplan-Meier and multivariate Cox proportional hazard models. RESULTS: 1909 SLNB staged patients were evaluated. Median follow-up time was 44 months. Median tumor thickness was 1.8 mm, ulceration was present in 31.8% of cases. The 5-year Overall Survival (OS) was 90.3% in SLNB negative patients (IB 96.2%, IIA 87.0%, IIB 78.1%, IIC 72.6%). Patients with micrometastases (stage IIIA/B) had a 5-year OS rate of 70.9% which was clearly less favorable than for stages I-II. Multivariate analysis revealed tumor thickness, ulceration, body site, histopathologic subtype and SLNB status as independent significant prognostic factors. CONCLUSION: Survival rates of patients with primary CM in stages I-II were shown to be much more favorable than previously reported from non sentinel node staged collectives. For future clinical trials, sample size calculations should be adapted using survival probabilities based on sentinel node staging.	2b
14697417	Radical prostatectomy, external beam radiotherapy <72 Gy, external beam radiotherapy > or =72 Gy, permanent seed implantation, or combined seeds/external beam radiotherapy for stage T1-T2 prostate cancer.	PURPOSE: To review the biochemical relapse-free survival (bRFS) rates after treatment with permanent seed implantation (PI), external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) <72 Gy (EBRT <72), EBRT > or =72 Gy (EBRT > or =72), combined seeds and EBRT (COMB), or radical prostatectomy (RP) for clinical Stage T1-T2 localized prostate cancer treated between 1990 and 1998. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The study population comprised 2991 consecutive patients treated at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation or Memorial Sloan Kettering at Mercy Medical Center. All cases had pretreatment prostate-specific antigen (iPSA) levels and biopsy Gleason scores (bGSs). Neoadjuvant androgen deprivation for < or =6 months was given in 622 cases (21%). No adjuvant therapy was given after local therapy. RP was used for 1034 patients (35%), EBRT <72 for 484 (16%), EBRT > or =72 for 301 (10%), PI for 950 (32%), and COMB for 222 patients (7%). The RP, EBRT <72, EBRT > or =72, and 154 PI patients were treated at Cleveland Clinic Foundation. The median radiation doses in EBRT <72 and EBRT > or =72 case was 68.4 and 78.0 Gy, respectively. The median follow-up time for all cases was 56 months (range 12-145). The median follow-up time for RP, EBRT <72, EBRT > or =72, PI, and COMB was 66, 75, 49, 47, and 46 months, respectively. Biochemical relapse was defined as PSA levels >0.2 for RP cases and three consecutive rising PSA levels (American Society for Therapeutic Radiology Oncology consensus definition) for all other cases. A multivariate analysis for factors affecting the bRFS rates was performed using the following variables: clinical T stage, iPSA, bGS, androgen deprivation, year of treatment, and treatment modality. The multivariate analysis was repeated excluding the EBRT <72 cases. RESULTS: The 5-year bRFS rate for RP, EBRT <72, EBRT > or =72, PI, and COMB was 81%, 51%, 81%, 83%, and 77%, respectively (p <0.001). The 7-year bRFS rate for RP, EBRT <72, EBRT > or =72, PI, and COMB was 76%, 48%, 81%, 75%, and 77%, respectively. Multivariate analysis, including all cases, showed iPSA (p <0.001), bGS (p <0.001), year of therapy (p <0.001), and treatment modality (p <0.001) to be independent predictors of relapse. Because EBRT <72 cases had distinctly worse outcomes, the analysis was repeated after excluding these cases to discern any differences among the other modalities. The multivariate analysis excluding the EBRT <72 cases revealed iPSA (p <0.001), bGS (p <0.001), and year of therapy (p = 0.001) to be the only independent predictors of relapse. Treatment modality (p = 0.95), clinical T stage (p = 0.09), and androgen deprivation (p = 0.56) were not independent predictors for failure. CONCLUSION: The biochemical failure rates were similar among PI, high-dose (> or =72 Gy) EBRT, COMB, and RP for localized prostate cancer. The outcomes were significantly worse for low-dose (<72 Gy) EBRT.	2a
7260853	A comparison of noninvasive imaging modalities in the melanoma patient.	The results of radionuclide (RN) liver scans, computed tomography (CT), and ultrasonography (US) were compared in 163 patients. Thirty-eight patients had all three studies, while ten were examined by CT and RN liver scans. One hundred fifteen patients had only US and RN studies. Radionuclide liver scanning demonstrated more false positive and negative studies than CT or US. Also, CT and US demonstrated more areas of metastasis during a single examination than RN liver scans. Ultrasonography displayed roughly the same accuracy of CT when a technically adequate examination was obtained. However, US was hampered by technically inadequate studies in 19% of 153 patients because of interfering intestinal gas. Computed tomography proved the most accurate and reliable modality in 48 patients.	4
22181338	The effect of Ginkgo biloba extract on genotoxic damage in patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma receiving thyroid remnant ablation with iodine-131.	"BACKGROUND: Radioiodine ((131)I) therapy is usually performed in patients with differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC). Although (131)I is generally considered safe, genotoxic damage has been demonstrated both in vivo and in vitro. The aim of the current study was to evaluate the effect of Ginkgo biloba extract (GBE) on the time-course of appearance, after (131)I therapy for DTC, of plasma factors with chromosome-damaging properties (so-called ""clastogenic"" factors [CFs]) and of micronuclei (MN) in lymphocytes. METHODS: Twenty-three patients (median age 42 years, range 18-73) with DTC receiving (131)I activity (3.7 GBq) for thyroid remnant ablation were randomly assigned to receive GBE (120 mg/day for one month; n=10) or placebo (n=13) in a double-blind manner. Blood samples were taken at various intervals (from baseline to 90 days) after (131)I therapy. The frequency of MN in blood lymphocytes was determined, and CFs were assayed in plasma by a method that used MN increase in lymphocytes from an healthy donor as the endpoint of the assay. RESULTS: MN in blood lymphocytes increased significantly after (131)I treatment in the placebo group, peaking at the 7th day (p=0.002) and slowly declining thereafter. In contrast, in similarly treated patients who were also treated with GBE both before and after (131)I treatment, a significant increase of blood lymphocyte MN level was not observed. In addition, only the placebo group showed a significant, progressive increase in CFs activity. This peaked at the 14th day (p=0.003 vs. baseline) and was still noted for the last plasma sample. The differences in the change in lymphocyte MN and CFs activity between the placebo and GBE-treated groups were significant (p<0.01 and p<0.05, respectively). Thyroid function tests, including serum thyroglobulin (Tg) and anti-Tg antibody levels, were never significantly different. CONCLUSIONS: GBE may protect from possible oxidative and genotoxic damage associated with (131)I treatment in patients requiring (131)I therapy for thyroid cancer, without affecting the clinical outcome. Further studies with larger cohorts of patients are needed to confirm this report and verify the beneficial effect of GBE in patients requiring (131)I therapy, particularly for those in whom repeated treatments and high activities of (131)I are required."	2b
667789	Pretreatment radiographic evaluation of patients with malignant melanoma.	During a four year period, 53 patients with malignant melanoma underwent extensive pretreatment radiographic evaluation for detection of occult extranodal metastatic disease. This included chest x-ray with tomography, upper G.I. series with small bowel follow through, barium enama, intravenous pyelogram, and radio-nuclide scans of the brain, liver and bone. All occult metastatic disease in asymptomatic patients was discovered on routine chest x-ray examination. There were three false positive examinations, which necessitated further diagnostic tests but there was no change in the final treatment decision. There was no alteration in the management of the remainder of the patients on the basis of the pretreatment radiographic evaluation.	3b
10705096	Preoperative concurrent chemoradiotherapy plus radical surgery for advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity: an analysis of long-term results.	Locoregionally advanced squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck continue to be a major clinical problem. We demonstrated in 1996 that preoperative concurrent cisplatin- or carboplatin-based chemotherapy and radiotherapy plus radical surgery in advanced oral cancer had minimal toxicity, had high clinical tumor response rates, was well tolerated and produced impressive complete response rates and a high 5-year survival rate. The purpose of the present study was the long-term follow-up of this treatment regimen for advanced oral carcinoma. Forty-eight patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity (including soft palate) were treated preoperatively with cisplatin- or carboplatin-based chemotherapy in combination with simultaneous irradiation to a target volume of 40 Gy, and 2-6 weeks later underwent curative surgery. All patients with advanced Stage II (n=7), Stage III (n=22) and Stage IV (n=19) were treated and followed for an average of 7.2 years (range: 61-144 months). The overall actuarial survival of all patients was 81.3% at 5 years and also at 10 years. Progression-free survival at both 5 and 10 years was 84.8% for all patients, and 85.7% for Stage II, 90.0% for Stage III, and 78.9% for Stage IV patients. Progression-free survival rates according to the histopathologic regression grade of primary tumor following preoperative chemoradiotherapy at 10 years were 40. 0% for Grade IIa, 88.9% for Grade IIb, 100% for Grade III, and 87.5% for Grade IV. Patients who achieved good responses histopathologically (Grades IIb, III, IV) had superior survival rates in comparison to patients with extensive residual tumor (Grade IIa) in surgically resected specimens (p=0.0012). A better histologic regression grade was also associated with a higher survival rate even in the long-term analysis. This treatment regimen for advanced oral cancer produced high clinical and pathologic complete response and survival rates with an acceptable acute toxicity profile and lack of late therapeutic complications. The long-term follow-up showed gratifying results even for advanced oral cancers without a substantial increase in distant metastasis and second primary malignancy.	4
29422935	Effectiveness of Acupuncture for Early Recovery of Bowel Function in Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.	OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of acupuncture therapy to reduce the duration of postoperative ileus (POI) and to enhance bowel function in cancer patients. METHODS: A systematic search of electronic databases for studies published from inception until January 2017 was carried out from six databases. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving the use of acupuncture and acupressure for POI and bowel function in cancer patients were identified. Outcomes were extracted from each study and pooled to determine the risk ratio and standardized mean difference. RESULTS: 10 RCTs involving 776 cancer patients were included. Compared with control groups (no acupuncture, sham acupuncture, and other active therapies), acupuncture was associated with shorter time to first flatus and time to first defecation. A subgroup analysis revealed that manual acupuncture was more effective on the time to first flatus and the time to first defecation; electroacupuncture was better in reducing the length of hospital stay. Compared with control groups (sham or no acupressure), acupressure was associated with shorter time to first flatus. However, GRADE approach indicated a low quality of evidence. CONCLUSIONS: Acupuncture and acupressure showed large effect size with significantly poor or inferior quality of included trials for enhancing bowel function in cancer patients after surgery. Further well-powered evidence is needed.	1a
22106845	Impact of relaxation training according to Yoga In Daily Life(R) system on self-esteem after breast cancer surgery.	OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this pilot study was to gather information on the immediate and short-term effects of relaxation training according to the Yoga In Daily Life((R)) system on the self-esteem of patients with breast cancer. DESIGN: This is a parallel-groups design. SETTINGS/LOCATION: Baseline interventions took place at the Institute for Oncology of Ljubljana (Slovenia). At discharge, the experimental group was issued with audiocassette recordings containing the instructions for relaxation training to be practiced individually at home for an additional 3 weeks. SUBJECTS: The convenience sample of 32 patients with breast cancer was recruited from an accessible population of hospitalized women. Patients were randomized to the experimental (n=16) and to the control group (n=16). INTERVENTIONS: Both groups received the same standard physiotherapy for 1 week, while the experimental group additionally received a group relaxation training sessions according to the Yoga in Daily Life((R)) system. At discharge, the experimental group was issued with audiocassette recordings containing similar instructions for relaxation training to be practiced individually at home for an additional 3 weeks. OUTCOME MEASURES: Outcome measures were obtained by blinded investigators (physiotherapists) using standardized questionnaires (Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale) at baseline (after the surgery); at 1 week (1 week postattendance; at discharge); and at 4 weeks (4 weeks postattendance); prior the commencement of radiation. RESULTS: Analysis of variance showed that there were statistically significant differences between the experimental and control group in all measuring self-esteem scores over the study period (p<0.0005). At the same time, the control group's scores remained unchanged over the study period (p>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that relaxation training according to the Yoga in Daily Life system could be a useful clinical physiotherapy intervention for patients who have breast cancer and who are experiencing low self-esteem. Although this kind of relaxation training can be applied to clinical oncology in Slovenia, more studies need to be done.	2b
11005552	Is adjuvant radiotherapy necessary after positive lymph node dissection in head and neck melanomas?	INTRODUCTION: Postoperative radiotherapy (PR) has been recommended in patients with advanced head and neck melanomas to improve regional control. This study examined the incidence of cervical recurrence among patients who did not receive PR after surgical management of node-positive head and neck melanomas. METHODS: A computerized search of a database listing more than 10,000 patients with melanoma prospectively acquired between 1971 and 1998 identified 217 patients with pathologically positive nodes who had undergone regional lymph node dissection (RLND). Of these patients, 21 had received PR and 196 had not. RESULTS: Median follow-up after RLND was 20 months for nonsurvivors and 32 months for survivors. The overall incidence of cervical recurrence was 14% (27/196). The 5-year cervical recurrence-free survival rate was 83%. Five-year cervical recurrence-free survival rates were 69% vs. 87% for patients with vs. without extranodal disease (P = .004), 96% vs. 81% for patients with nonpalpable vs. palpable nodes (P = .0761), and 82% vs. 91% for patients with one to three positive nodes vs. more than three positive nodes (P = .256). Multivariate analysis, which included the timing of nodal disease presentation and the effect of systemic adjuvant therapy, identified extranodal disease as the only independent predictor of cervical recurrence (P = .034). Cervical recurrence was significantly related to the subsequent occurrence of distant relapse. CONCLUSIONS: The low incidence of cervical recurrence after RLND in patients with node-positive head and neck melanomas does not justify the routine use of PR. The only subset of patients who may benefit from PR are those with extranodal disease.	3b
14596519	A systematic overview of radiation therapy effects in skeletal metastases.	A systematic review of radiation therapy trials in several tumour types was performed by The Swedish Council of Technology Assessment in Health Care (SBU). The procedures for evaluation of the scientific literature are described separately (Acta Oncol 2003; 42: 357-365). This synthesis of the literature on radiation therapy for skeletal metastases is based on data from 16 randomized trials. Moreover, data from 20 prospective studies, 5 retrospective studies and 22 other articles were used. A total of 63 scientific articles are included, involving 8051 patients. The results were compared with those of a similar overview from 1996 including 13,054 patients. The conclusions reached can be summarized as follows: Irradiation of skeletal metastases is, with few exceptions, a palliative treatment. There is strong evidence that radiotherapy of skeletal metastases gives an overall (complete and partial pain relief) in more than 80% of patients. There is strong evidence that the duration of pain relief in at least 50% of patients lasts for > or = 6 months. There is convincing evidence that pain relief, in terms of degree and duration, does not depend on the fractionation schedules applied. Irrespective of the fractionation schedule used at irradiation, the number of later complications, such as spinal cord compression or pathological fractures, at the index fields are low. There are some data showing that the difference in cost between single and multifraction treatment is small. However, these data do not permit any firm conclusions to be drawn. Several reports indicate that early diagnosis and early therapy of spinal cord compression are the two most important predictors of a favourable clinical outcome after radiotherapy. However, no controlled studies have been undertaken. When the diagnosis of spinal cord compression is late, a favourable outcome might depend on the radio-responsiveness of the tumour. The documentation is weak and no conclusions can be drawn. There is some evidence that a small proportion of totally paralytic patients can regain walking function after radiotherapy. There is strong evidence that the radionuclides 89Sr and 153Sm are efficient when they are used as a systemic treatment of generalized bone pain due to metastasis from carcinomas of the prostate and breast. Overall bone pain relief occurs in about 60-80% of patients with a median response duration of 2-4 months. There is strong evidence that intravenous treatment with bisphosphonates in patients with myeloma and osteolytic bone metastasis due to carcinoma of the breast significantly decreases the number of skeleton-related events and bone pain.	1a
26010858	Ipilimumab-induced hypophysitis in melanoma patients: an Australian case series.	BACKGROUND: Ipilimumab (Yervoy; Bristol-Myers Squibb) is a novel fully humanised monoclonal antibody that blocks cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4, an immune checkpoint molecule, to augment anti-tumour T-cell responses. It is associated with significant immune-related side-effects including hypophysitis. AIM: We reviewed the clinical and biochemical characteristics of 10 patients with ipilimumab-induced hypophysitis (IH), and developed guidelines for the early detection and management of IH based on our experiences at three major teaching hospitals in Sydney. METHODS: All patients were evaluated at the Crown Princess Mary Cancer Centre and Department of Endocrinology, Westmead Hospital, Department of Endocrinology, Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, the Melanoma Institute Australia and Macarthur Cancer Therapy Centre, Campbelltown Hospital from 2010 to 2014. Relevant data were extracted by review of medical records. Main outcome measures included clinical features, hormone profile and radiological findings associated with IH, and presence of pituitary recovery. RESULTS: Ten patients were identified with IH. In four patients who underwent monitoring of plasma cortisol, there was a fall in levels in the weeks prior to presentation. The pituitary-adrenal and pituitary-thyroid axes were affected in the majority of patients, with the need for physiological hormone replacement. Imaging abnormalities were identified in five of 10 patients, and resolved without high-dose glucocorticoid therapy. To date, all patients remain on levothyroxine and hydrocortisone replacement, where appropriate. CONCLUSIONS: There is significant morbidity associated with development of IH. We suggest guidelines to assist with early recognition and therapeutic intervention.	4
19212120	Resection of primary pancreatic cancer and liver metastasis: a systematic review.	Resection of liver metastases for locally resectable pancreatic cancer has rarely been performed. Recently, promising results regarding morbidity and mortality as well as long-term survival have been shown. Thus, we conducted a systematic review of the literature on pancreatic cancer resection with associated liver metastasis resection. There are 3 case reports and 18 studies including less than 10 patients. Only three studies are larger series with 10 or more patients in whom pancreatic resections and hepatic metastasectomies were performed. Here, morbidity and mortality ranged from 24.1 to 26% and from 0 to 4.3%, respectively. Median survival was reported to be between 5.8 and 11.4 months. In total, all identified studies included 103 patients in whom a metastasis resection was performed. Liver metastasis resection for locally resectable pancreatic cancer can be performed in selected cases with low morbidity and mortality. Overall survival in cases with one or few liver metastases which are concomitantly resected seems to be comparable to cases without evidence of metastasis. Therefore, randomized controlled clinical trials will have to be initiated to determine the value of such resections and to identify factors which will allow for selection of patients in whom the extension of the resectability criteria might confer a survival benefit.	4
23331515	Evidence for the use of Levomepromazine for symptom control in the palliative care setting: a systematic review.	"BACKGROUND: Levomepromazine is an antipsychotic drug that is used clinically for a variety of distressing symptoms in palliative and end-of-life care. We undertook a systematic review based on the question ""What is the published evidence for the use of levomepromazine in palliative symptom control?"". METHODS: To determine the level of evidence for the use of levomepromazine in palliative symptom control, and to discover gaps in evidence, relevant studies were identified using a detailed, multi-step search strategy. Emerging data was then scrutinized using appropriate assessment tools, and the strength of evidence systematically graded in accordance with the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine's 'levels of evidence' tool. The electronic databases Medline, Embase, Cochrane, PsychInfo and Ovid Nursing, together with hand-searching and cross-referencing provided the full research platform on which the review is based. RESULTS: 33 articles including 9 systematic reviews met the inclusion criteria: 15 on palliative sedation, 8 regarding nausea and three on delirium and restlessness, one on pain and six with other foci. The studies varied greatly in both design and sample size. Levels of evidence ranged from level 2b to level 5, with the majority being level 3 (non-randomized, non-consecutive or cohort studies n = 22), with the quality of reporting for the included studies being only low to medium. CONCLUSION: Levomepromazine is widely used in palliative care as antipsychotic, anxiolytic, antiemetic and sedative drug. However, the supporting evidence is limited to open series and case reports. Thus prospective randomized trials are needed to support evidence-based guidelines."	2a
9114116	Neoplastic invasion of the laryngeal cartilage: reassessment of criteria for diagnosis at CT.	PURPOSE: To evaluate eight different diagnostic criteria to help detect neoplastic invasion of laryngeal cartilage at computed tomography (CT). MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a prospective series, 111 patients with carcinoma of the larynx or hypopharynx underwent thin-section, contrast material-enhanced CT before total or partial laryngectomy. The following CT criteria were evaluated: extralaryngeal tumor, sclerosis, tumor adjacent to nonossified cartilage, serpiginous contour, erosion or lysis, obliteration of marrow space, cartilaginous blowout, and bowing. Histologic findings were correlated with findings on CT scans obtained at each level. RESULTS: Histologically, 122 of 412 cartilages were invaded. Depending on the diagnostic criteria and each specific cartilage, there was great variation in sensitivity (7%-83%) and specificity (40%-100%). Sclerosis was the most sensitive criteria in all cartilages but often corresponded to reactive inflammation in the thyroid cartilage. Extralaryngeal tumor and erosion or lysis yielded the highest specificity. Tumor adjacent to nonossified cartilage, serpiginous contour, and obliteration of marrow space were specific although not sensitive signs of invasion in the arytenoid and cricoid cartilage and were nonspecific in the thyroid cartilage. Blowout and bowing were not useful. Selection of the appropriate combination of criteria enabled an overall sensitivity of 91% (associated specificity, 68%) or an overall specificity of 79% (associated sensitivity, 82%). CONCLUSION: Detection of neoplastic cartilage invasion with CT greatly depended on the appropriate use of individual and combined CT criteria.	2b
32349874	The added value of sentinel node mapping in endometrial cancer.	OBJECTIVE: To evaluate long-term oncological outcomes and the added value of sentinel lymph node sampling (SLN) compared to pelvic lymph node dissection (LND) in patients with endometrial cancer (EC). METHODS: During the evaluation phase of SLN for EC, we performed LND and SLN and retrospectively compared the oncologic outcome with the immediate non-overlapping historical era during which patients underwent LND. RESULTS: From 2007 to 2010, 193 patients underwent LND and from December 2010 to 2014, 250 patients had SLN mapping with completion LND. Both groups had similar clinical characteristics. During a median follow-up period of 6.9 years, addition of SLN was associated with more favorable oncological outcomes compared to LND with 6-year overall survival (OS) of 90% compared to 81% (p = 0.009), and progression free survival (PFS) of 85% compared to 75% (p = 0.01) respectively. SLN was associated with improved OS (HR 0.5, 95% CI 0.3-0.8, p = 0.004), and PFS (HR 0.6, 95% CI 0.4-0.9, p = 0.03) in a multivariable analysis, adjusted for age, ASA score, stage, grade, non-endometrioid histology, and LVSI. Patients who were staged with SLN were less likely to have a recurrence in the pelvis or lymph node basins compared to patients who underwent LND only (6-year recurrence-free survival 95% vs 90%, p = 0.04). CONCLUSION: Addition of SLN to LND was ultimately associated with improved clinical outcomes compared to LND alone in patients with endometrial cancer undergoing surgical staging, suggesting that the data provided by the analysis of the SLN added relevant clinical information, and improved the decision on adjuvant therapy.	4
16792835	Receiver operating characteristics of the prostate specific antigen test in an unselected population.	OBJECTIVES: To determine the operating characteristics of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing and prostate cancer diagnosis rates in men who have had an initial PSA test in Tayside. SETTING: A retrospective cohort study in Tayside, Scotland from 1992 to 2001. METHODS: In total, 20,623 men were PSA tested during the period 1992-2001. After exclusions, 19,660 were studied. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated for various PSA cut-off values by age group using logistic regression weighted for verification bias (biopsy). Cox regression analysis was performed using six test pattern cohorts. RESULTS: The annual rate of PSA testing increased from 5.1 per 1000 man years in 1992 to 21.3 per 1000 man years in 2001. The average number of PSA tests per patient increased from 1.11 in 1992 to 2.57 in 2001. Prostate cancer diagnosis and death rates remained constant from 1995 onward. The PSA test had generally inadequate sensitivity and specificity values, so a unique cut-off could not be found for the two older age groups which could be used as a recommendation for biopsy. The commonly used 4 ng/mL cut-off was reasonably sensitive and specific only for the under 60 age group with values of 92.4% and 90.7%, respectively. For prostate cancer diagnosis, the hazard ratios (HR) were reported relative to those with a series of all normal tests. For those with an initially normal PSA test who had at least one abnormal retest result the HR for diagnosis was 10.43 (95% confidence interval [CI] 6.17-17.63). For those with initially abnormal tests with normal retests HR = 1.63 (95% CI 0.65-4.07). CONCLUSIONS: There are no optimal PSA cut-off values for older age groups with which to make a confident referral for biopsy. The increase in PSA testing and the questionable cut-off values of the test calls for the development of an alternative screening strategy.	2a
31776037	Multicenter study comparing oncologic outcomes after lymph node assessment via a sentinel lymph node algorithm versus comprehensive pelvic and paraaortic lymphadenectomy in patients with serous and clear cell endometrial carcinoma.	OBJECTIVES: To compare survival after nodal assessment using a sentinel lymph node (SLN) algorithm versus comprehensive pelvic and paraaortic lymphadenectomy (LND) in serous or clear cell endometrial carcinoma, and to compare survival in node-negative cases. METHODS: Three-year recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival were compared between one institution that used comprehensive LND to the renal veins and a second institution that used an SLN algorithm with ultra-staging with inverse-probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) derived from propensity scores to adjust for covariate imbalance between cohorts. RESULTS: 214 patients were identified (118 SLN cohort, 96 LND cohort). Adjuvant therapy differed between the cohorts; 84% and 40% in the SLN and LND cohorts, respectively, received chemotherapy +/- radiation therapy. The IPTW-adjusted 3-year RFS rates were 69% and 80%, respectively. The IPTW-adjusted 3-year OS rates were 88% and 77%, respectively. The IPTW-adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for the association of surgical approach (SLN vs LND) with progression and death was 1.46 (95% CI: 0.70-3.04) and 0.44 (95% CI: 0.19-1.02), respectively. In the 168 node-negative cases, the IPTW-adjusted 3-year RFS rates were 73% and 91%, respectively. The IPTW-adjusted 3-year OS rates were 88% and 86%, respectively. In this subgroup, IPTW-adjusted HR for the association of surgical approach (SLN vs LND) with progression and death was 3.12 (95% CI: 1.02-9.57) and 0.69 (95% CI: 0.24-1.95), respectively. CONCLUSION: OS was not compromised with the SLN algorithm. SLN may be associated with a decreased RFS but similar OS in node-negative cases despite the majority receiving chemotherapy. This may be due to differences in surveillance.	4
17013897	PSA doubling time predicts the outcome after active surveillance in screening-detected prostate cancer: results from the European randomized study of screening for prostate cancer, Sweden section.	This study reports the outcome of active surveillance in men with PSA screening-detected prostate cancer (PC), and PSA doubling time (PSADT) was evaluated as a predictor of selecting patients to active treatment or surveillance. On December 31, 1994, 10,000 men were randomized to biennial PSA testing. Through to December 2004, a total of 660 men were diagnosed with PC, of whom 270 managed with initial surveillance. Of these 270 patients, 104 (39%) received active treatment during follow-up, 70 radical prostatectomy, 24 radiation and 10 endocrine treatment. Those who received active treatment during follow-up (mean 63 months) were significantly younger (62.6 vs. 65.5 years, p < 0.0001) and had a shorter PSADT (3.7 vs. 12 years, p < 0.0001). PSA relapse was observed in 9 of 70 patients who received RRP during a mean follow-up of 37 months. Seven of these nine PSA relapses were in the patients with preoperative PSADT < 2 years. None of the 37 operated patients with a PSADT > 4 years had a PSA relapse. In a Cox regression analysis adjusted for PSA, ratio-free PSA and amount of cancer in biopsy, only the preoperative PSADT was statistically significant predictor of PSA relapse in p = 0.031. The optimal candidate for surveillance is a man with early, low-grade, low-stage PC and a PSADT > 4 years. In younger men with a PSADT of less than 4 years, surveillance does not seem to be a justified alternative, and patient should be informed about the risk with such an approach.	2a
16027437	Randomized trial of antioxidant vitamins to prevent acute adverse effects of radiation therapy in head and neck cancer patients.	PURPOSE: Many cancer patients take antioxidant vitamin supplements with the hope of improving the outcome of conventional therapies and of reducing the adverse effects of these treatments. A randomized trial was conducted to determine whether supplementation with antioxidant vitamins could reduce the occurrence and severity of acute adverse effects of radiation therapy and improve quality of life without compromising treatment efficacy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial among 540 head and neck cancer patients treated with radiation therapy. Patients were randomly assigned into two arms. The supplementation with alpha-tocopherol (400 IU/d) and beta-carotene (30 mg/d) or placebos was administered during radiation therapy and for 3 years thereafter. During the course of the trial, supplementation with beta-carotene was discontinued because of ethical concerns. RESULTS: Patients randomly assigned in the supplement arm tended to have less severe acute adverse effects during radiation therapy (odds ratio [OR], 0.72; 95% CI, 0.52 to 1.02). The reduction was statistically significant when the supplementation combined alpha-tocopherol and beta-carotene for adverse effects to the larynx (OR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.21 to 0.71) and overall at any site (OR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.20 to 0.74). Quality of life was not improved by the supplementation. The rate of local recurrence of the head and neck tumor tended to be higher in the supplement arm of the trial (hazard ratio, 1.37; 95% CI, 0.93 to 2.02). CONCLUSION: Supplementation with high doses of alpha-tocopherol and beta-carotene during radiation therapy could reduce the severity of treatment adverse effects. However, this trial suggests that use of high doses of antioxidants as adjuvant therapy might compromise radiation treatment efficacy.	2b
29791913	Lymphadenectomy and Adjuvant Therapy Improve Survival with Uterine Carcinosarcoma: A Large Retrospective Cohort Study.	OBJECTIVE: Uterine carcinosarcoma is a rare, aggressive subtype of endometrial cancer. Treatment consists of hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, and lymphadenectomy (LND). The survival benefit of LND in relation to adjuvant radio- and/or chemotherapy is unclear. We evaluated the impact of LND on survival in relation to adjuvant therapy in uterine carcinosarcoma. METHODS: Retrospective data on 1,140 cases were combined from the Netherlands Cancer Registry (NCR) and the nationwide network and registry of histo- and cytopathology in the Netherlands (PALGA). LND was defined as the removal of any nodes. Additionally, cases where 10 nodes or less (LND </=10) or more than 10 nodes (LND > 10) were removed were analyzed separately. Adjuvant therapy was evaluated as radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or radiochemotherapy. Associations were analyzed by chi2 test, log-rank test, and Cox regression analysis. RESULTS: Overall survival (OS) had improved after total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy with LND > 10 (HR 0.62, 95% CI 0.47-0.83). Adjuvant therapy was related to OS with an HR of 0.64 (95% CI 0.54-0.75) for radiotherapy, an HR of 0.65 (95% CI 0.48-0.88) for chemotherapy, and an HR of 0.25 (95% CI 0.13-0.46) for radiochemotherapy. Additionally, adjuvant treatment was related to OS when lymph nodes were positive (HR 0.22, 95% CI 0.11-0.42), but not when they were negative. CONCLUSION: LND is related to improved survival when more than 10 nodes are removed. Adjuvant therapy improves survival when LND is omitted, or when nodes are positive.	3a
25040674	Cutaneous adverse events in patients treated with BRAF inhibitor-based therapies for metastatic melanoma for longer than 52 weeks.	BACKGROUND: BRAF inhibitor-based therapies have been shown to induce cutaneous toxicities, with onset generally in the first 8-26 weeks of therapy. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether cutaneous toxicities persist in patients who have remained on BRAF inhibitor-based therapies for longer than 52 weeks, and therefore whether ongoing dermatology assessment is required. METHODS: All patients treated with the BRAF inhibitors vemurafenib or dabrafenib or combination BRAF inhibitor and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitor therapy at Westmead Hospital, Sydney, Australia underwent regular dermatological assessments for the duration of therapy. All patients enrolled in a clinical trial, and 18% of patients in the compassionate access scheme underwent a baseline assessment prior to commencement of therapy and every 4-8 weeks thereafter. Patients' adverse events were recorded in a specific database. RESULTS: Patients continued to develop cutaneous adverse events after 52 weeks of continuous therapy. Patients on single-agent BRAF inhibitor therapy suffered from Grover disease (45%), plantar hyperkeratosis (45%), verrucal keratosis (18%) and even cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (16%). The most frequent adverse event seen in patients in the combination BRAF and MEK inhibitor group was an acneiform eruption (40%). CONCLUSIONS: Patients on BRAF inhibitor-based therapies need to continue to have regular dermatological follow-up independent of the duration of their therapy.	3a
18191322	Using PSA to guide timing of androgen deprivation in patients with T0-4 N0-2 M0 prostate cancer not suitable for local curative treatment (EORTC 30891).	OBJECTIVE: EORTC trial 30891 compared immediate versus deferred androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) in T0-4 N0-2 M0 prostate cancer (PCa). Many patients randomly assigned to deferred ADT did not require ADT because they died before becoming symptomatic. The question arises whether serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels may be used to decide when to initiate ADT in PCa not suitable for local curative treatment. METHODS: PSA data at baseline, PSA doubling time (PSADT) in patients receiving no ADT, and time to PSA relapse (>2 ng/ml) in patients whose PSA declined to <2 ng/ml within the first year after immediate ADT were analyzed in 939 eligible patients randomly assigned to immediate (n=468) or deferred ADT (n=471). RESULTS: In both arms, patients with a baseline PSA>50 ng/ml were at a>3.5-fold higher risk to die of PCa than patients with a baseline PSA<or=8 ng/ml. If baseline PSA was between 8 and 50 ng/ml, the risk of PCa death was approximately 7.5-fold higher in patients with PSADT<12 mo than in patients with PSADT>12 mo. Time to PSA relapse after response to immediate ADT correlated significantly with baseline PSA, suggesting that baseline PSA may also reflect disease aggressiveness. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with a baseline PSA>50 ng/ml and/or a PSADT<12 mo were at increased risk to die from PCa and might have benefited from immediate ADT, whereas patients with a baseline PSA<50 ng/ml and a slow PSADT (>12 mo) were likely to die of causes unrelated to PCa, and thus could be spared the burden of immediate ADT.	2a
2670188	A randomized clinical trial of home nursing care for lung cancer patients.	A randomized clinical trial was conducted to assess the effects of home nursing care for patients with progressive lung cancer. One hundred sixty-six patients were assigned to either an oncology home care group (OHC) that received care from oncology home care nurses, a standard home care group (SHC) that received care from regular home care nurses, or an office care group (OC) that received whatever care they needed except for home care. Patients were entered into the study 2 months after diagnosis and followed for 6 months. Patients were interviewed at 6-week intervals across five occasions. At the end of the study, there were no differences in pain, mood disturbance, and concerns among the three groups. There were significant differences in symptom distress, enforced social dependency, and health perceptions. The two home nursing care groups had less distress and greater independence 6 weeks longer than the office care group. In addition, the two home nursing care groups steadily reported worse health perceptions over time. Thus, it was remarkable that the office care group, which indicated more symptom distress and social dependency with time, also indicated perceptions of improved health with time. These results suggest that home nursing care assists patients with forestalling distress from symptoms and maintaining their independence longer in comparison to no home nursing care. Home care may also include assisting patients in acknowledging the reality of their situation.	1b
23374004	A prospective randomized trial: a comparison of the analgesic effect and toxicity of 153Sm radioisotope treatment in monotherapy and combined therapy including local external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) among metastatic castrate resistance prostate cancer (mCRPC) patients with painful bone metastases.	Bone metastases in prostate cancer constitute the most frequent cause of systemic failure in treatment, which results in numerous complications and finally leads to patient's death. Pain is one of the first and most important clinical symptoms of bone metastases and can be found among more than 80% of patients. Therefore, the most analgetic effective and simultaneously the least toxic treatment is an important point of therapeutic management in this group of patients. The aim of this prospective clinical trial was a comparison of analgetic effectiveness and toxicity of monotherapy with 153Sm isotope to combined therapy (153Sm + EBRT) among patients diagnosed with multiple painful bone metastases due to CRPC (mCRPC). 177 patients with mCRPC were included into the prospective randomised clinical trial in which 89 patients were assigned to the 153Sm isotope monotherapy, while 88 patients were assigned to the combined therapy including 153Sm isotope therapy and EBRT. All patients were diagnosed (bone scan and X-ray or/and CT or/and MRI) with painful bone metastases (bone pain intensity >= 6 according to VAS classification). The following additional inclusion criteria were established: histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of prostate, multifocal bone metastases, no prior chemotherapy or palliative radiotherapy to bone. All patients signed informed consent.The combination of the isotope therapy with EBRT was more effective analgetic treatment than isotope therapy alone. The highest pain decline was noticed in the first weeks after treatment termination. In the whole group, a total or partial analgesic effect was observed among 154 (87%) patients while among 23 (13%) patients there was a lack of analgesic effect or even pain intensification. The results of this clinical trial demonstrated that for patients with multiple mCRPC it is recommended to combine the 153Sm isotope therapy with local EBRT because of a greater analgetic effect. It is important to note that combined therapy did not intensify the toxicity of treatment.	1b
8558223	Interferon alfa-2b adjuvant therapy of high-risk resected cutaneous melanoma: the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Trial EST 1684.	PURPOSE: Interferon alfa-2b (IFN alpha-2b) exhibits antitumor activity in metastatic melanoma and on this basis has been evaluated as an adjuvant therapy following surgery for deep primary (T4) or regionally metastatic (N1) melanoma. METHODS: A randomized controlled study of IFN alpha-2b (Schering-Plough, Kenilworth, NJ) administered at maximum-tolerated doses of 20 MU/m2/d intravenously (i.v.) for 1 month and 10 MU/m2 three times per week subcutaneously (SC) for 48 weeks versus observation, was conducted by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) in 287 patients. RESULTS: A significant prolongation of relapse-free survival (P = .0023, one-sided) and prolongation of overall survival (P = .0237, one-sided) was observed with IFN alpha-2b therapy in this trial, which is now mature with a median follow-up time of 6.9 years. The impact of treatment on relapse rate is most pronounced early during the treatment interval. The overall benefit of treatment in this trial was analyzed stratified by tumor burden and the presence or absence of microscopic nonpalpable and palpable regional lymph node metastasis. The benefit of therapy with IFN alpha-2b was greatest among node-positive strata. Toxicity of IFN alpha-2b required dose modification in the majority of patients, but treatment at > or = 80% of the scheduled dose was feasible in the majority of patients through the IV phase of treatment, and for more than 3 months of SC maintenance therapy. Discontinuation of treatment due to toxicity was infrequent after the fourth month of therapy. CONCLUSION: IFN alpha-2b prolongs the relapse-free interval and overall survival of high-risk resected melanoma patients. The increment in median disease-free survival (from 1 to 1.7 years) and overall survival (from 2.8 to 3.8 years) that results from this therapy is associated with a 42% improvement in the fraction of patients who are continuously disease-free after treatment with IFN (from 26% to 37%) in comparison to observation. IFN alpha-2b is the first agent to show a significant benefit in relapse-free and overall survival of high-risk melanoma patients in a randomized controlled trial.	1b
17786531	Prognostic significance of pathologic nodal status in patients with resected pancreatic cancer.	BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the significance of pathologic nodal assessment and extent of nodal metastases on patient outcome in patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospectively maintained pancreatic cancer database was reviewed, and 696 consecutive patients were identified who underwent resection for pancreatic adenocarcinoma between 1995 and 2005. Overall survival was compared to lymph node (LN) status, absolute number of pathologically assessed LN, and LN ratio expressed as the number of positive LN to the total LN assessed. RESULTS: Of the 696 patients, 598 (86%) had pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD), and 96 (14%) had distal pancreatectomy (DP). For all patients, median follow-up was 13 months (range, 0-122 months), and estimated 5-year survival was 16%. A total of 243 (35%) patients were LN-negative (N0) and had a median survival of 27 months. When assessed as a continuous variable, the number of pathologically assessed LN did not correlate with survival for N0 patients undergoing either PD or DP. The median survival for the 453 patients with node-positive (N1) disease was 16 months. When analyzed as a continuous variable, the absolute number of positive LNs was a significant predictor of survival for N1 patients with a linear relationship up to eight positive LNs. LN ratio, as a continuous variable, also predicted survival with a linear relationship up to a ratio of 0.35. A ratio of 0.18 was associated with a 19-month median survival and served as the best cutoff, p < 0.01. CONCLUSIONS: The absolute number of positive LNs and LN ratio are strong predictors of survival for patients with node-positive pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Inadequate surgical lymphadenectomy or pathologic LN assessment understages node-negative patients.	2b
22833605	Cutaneous melanoma attributable to sunbed use: systematic review and meta-analysis.	OBJECTIVE: To estimate the burden of melanoma resulting from sunbed use in western Europe. DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, ISI Web of Science (Science Citation Index Expanded), Embase, Pascal, Cochrane Library, LILACS, and MedCarib, along with published surveys reporting prevalence of sunbed use at national level in Europe. STUDY SELECTION: Observational studies reporting a measure of risk for skin cancer (cutaneous melanoma, squamous cell carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma) associated with ever use of sunbeds. RESULTS: Based on 27 studies ever use of sunbeds was associated with a summary relative risk of 1.20 (95% confidence interval 1.08 to 1.34). Publication bias was not evident. Restricting the analysis to cohorts and population based studies, the summary relative risk was 1.25 (1.09 to 1.43). Calculations for dose-response showed a 1.8% (95% confidence interval 0% to 3.8%) increase in risk of melanoma for each additional session of sunbed use per year. Based on 13 informative studies, first use of sunbeds before age 35 years was associated with a summary relative risk of 1.87 (1.41 to 2.48), with no indication of heterogeneity between studies. By using prevalence data from surveys and data from GLOBOCAN 2008, in 2008 in the 15 original member countries of the European Community plus three countries that were members of the European Free Trade Association, an estimated 3438 cases of melanoma could be attributable to sunbed use, most (n=2341) occurring among women. CONCLUSIONS: Sunbed use is associated with a significant increase in risk of melanoma. This risk increases with number of sunbed sessions and with initial usage at a young age (<35 years). The cancerous damage associated with sunbed use is substantial and could be avoided by strict regulations.	2a
26829507	Obesity and endometrial hyperplasia and cancer in premenopausal women: A systematic review.	OBJECTIVE: To systematically review the literature on the association between obesity and endometrial hyperplasia or cancer in premenopausal women. DATA SOURCES: We searched the bibliographic databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed, and CINAHL (inception to May 5, 2015), and checked reference lists of included studies and systematic reviews. STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Studies of more than 50 women with endometrial pathology diagnosed during premenopause that reported on obesity as a risk factor were eligible. STUDY APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS METHODS: Study identification and data extraction were independently performed by 2 authors. Where possible, data were pooled in a generic inverse variance forest plot. Heterogeneity was reported using the I(2) statistic. RESULTS: Nine case-control studies of moderate quality were included. Quantitative analysis of 5 studies showed a dose-response relationship of body mass index and increased risk of endometrial cancer. For studies of women with body mass index of >/=25, the pooled odds ratio was 3.85 (95% confidence interval 2.53-5.84); body mass index of >/=30 was 5.25 (4.00-6.90); and body mass index of >/=40 was 19.79 (11.18-35.03). CONCLUSION: Body mass index is a consistent and leading risk factor for endometrial complex hyperplasia or cancer in premenopausal women. Body mass index should be considered when deciding to assess the endometrium in symptomatic premenopausal women.	3a
20165985	Conditional survival after surgical treatment of melanoma: an analysis of the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database.	BACKGROUND: Survival curves following surgical treatment of cutaneous melanoma are heavily influenced by early deaths. Therefore, survival estimates may be misleading for long-term cancer survivors. We examined whether conditional survival (CS) is more accurate in predicting long-term melanoma survival. METHODS: We used the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database (1992-2005) to identify patients who underwent surgical treatment for melanoma. We included patients with T2-T4 disease and with known nodal status. Patients were stratified into low-risk (T2-3N0M0) and high-risk (T4N0M0 or T2-4N1-3M0) categories. We defined CS as time-specific estimates conditioned on living to a certain point in follow-up, and calculated 10-year cancer-specific survival curves conditioned on annual survival. We adjusted for potential confounders using a Cox proportional hazards regression model (alpha = 0.05). RESULTS: A total of 8647 patients met inclusion criteria (low-risk, 5987 [69.2%]; high-risk, 2660 [30.8%]). At diagnosis, low-risk patients had a significantly better 10-year survival rate (low-risk, 79.6%; high-risk, 41.2%; P < 0.001). On CS analysis, survival differences remained until 8 years after treatment, after which 10-year cancer-specific survival rates were no longer significantly different (P = 0.51) for low-risk (95.4%) and high-risk (91.7%) groups. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that age, gender, location, and ulceration (initial predictors of survival) were no longer predictive after 8 years of survival. CONCLUSIONS: For patients who survive 8 years after surgical treatment of melanoma, CS data become discordant with traditionally used estimates. Our findings have important implications for patient counseling, as high-risk melanoma survivors may require no more intensive surveillance than low-risk survivors 8 years after treatment.	2b
15538220	A systematic review and critique of the literature relating hospital or surgeon volume to health outcomes for 3 urological cancer procedures.	"PURPOSE: We performed a systematic review and critique of the literature of the relationship between hospital or surgeon volume and health outcomes in patients undergoing radical surgery for cancer of the bladder, kidney or prostate. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four electronic databases were searched to identify studies that describe the relationship between hospital or surgeon volume and health outcomes. RESULTS: All included studies were performed in North America. A total of 12 studies were found that related hospital volume to outcomes. For radical prostatectomy and cystectomy all 8 included studies showed improvement in at least 1 outcome measure with increasing volume and never deterioration. For nephrectomy the 4 included studies produced conflicting results. Four studies were found that related surgeon volume to outcomes. All radical prostatectomy and cystectomy studies showed that some outcomes were better with higher surgeon volume and never deterioration. We did not find any studies of the effect of surgeon volume on outcomes after nephrectomy. The 3 studies of the combined effect of hospital and surgeon volume on outcomes after radical prostatectomy or cystectomy suggest that high volume hospitals have better outcomes, in part because of the effect of surgeon volume and vice versa. CONCLUSIONS: Outcomes after radical prostatectomy and cystectomy are on average likely to be better if these procedures are performed by and at high volume providers. For radical nephrectomy the evidence is unclear. The impact of volume based policies (increasing volume to improve outcomes) depends on the extent to which ""practice makes perfect"" explains the observed results. Further studies should explicitly address selective referral and confounding as alternative explanations. Longitudinal studies should be performed to evaluate the impact of volume based policies."	2a
18580439	The impact of lymph node number on survival in patients with lymph node-negative pancreatic cancer.	OBJECTIVES: The role of lymph node (LN) dissection for pancreatic cancer remains uncertain, and guidelines for a minimum LN number have not been established. We hypothesized that LN number in node-negative (N0) pancreatic cancer influences survival. METHODS: The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database was queried for patients undergoing resection for N0 pancreatic adenocarcinoma between 1988 and 2003. Lymph node number was categorized as 1-10, 11-20, and >20. RESULTS: In a cohort of 1915 patients, the median LN number was 7 (range 1-57); 1365 (71%) patients had <11 LN. Survival was significantly better in the 11 to 20 compared with the 1-10 group (median, 20 vs 15 months, respectively, P < 0.0001); no difference was observed between the 11-20 and >20 groups (median, 20 vs 23 months, respectively, P = 0.14). Multivariate analysis demonstrated the prognostic significance of LN number for determining overall survival (hazard ratio 0.98, 95% confidence interval: 0.97-0.99; P<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Pancreatic cancer lymphadenectomy with examination of >10 LN is associated with improved survival in N0 disease and should be considered a benchmark for adequacy of surgery and/or pathology. Currently, only a minority of patients are assessed by this measure. The variation in LN number may be indicative of diverse surgical technique and/or pathologic analysis and warrants further investigation.	2b
28618234	Successful Treatment of Acute Radiation Proctitis with Aloe Vera: A Preliminary Randomized Controlled Clinical Trial.	"BACKGROUND: Acute radiation proctitis (ARP) is a common side-effect that affects up to 50% of patients receiving radiotherapy. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of a topical preparation of Aloe vera in the treatment of ARP induced by radiotherapy of pelvic area. SUBJECTS AND INTERVENTIONS: In this double-blind placebo-controlled trial, 20 consecutive patients with ARP after external-beam radiation therapy (46-72 Gy) of pelvic malignancies were randomized to receive either Aloe vera 3% or placebo ointment, 1 g twice daily for 4 weeks. These patients presented with at least two of the following symptoms: rectal bleeding, abdominal/rectal pain, diarrhea, or fecal urgency. These symptoms were rated by the patients in terms of their severity (grade 0-4) for each of the symptoms mentioned earlier at baseline and then weekly for 4 weeks. A symptom index was calculated by the addition of the scores (16 most symptomatic). Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) acute toxicity criteria and psychosocial status of the patients were also recorded weekly. The lifestyle impact of the symptoms was assessed by questionnaire grading from 0 (no effect on daily activity) to 4 (afraid to leave home). RESULTS: There was a significant (p < 0.05) improvement in the symptom index (before treatment vs. after treatment with Aloe vera) for diarrhea (median score: 0.67 vs. 0.11), fecal urgency (median score: 0.89 vs. 0.11), clinical presentation total (median score: 4.33 vs. 1.22), RTOG total (median score: 2.89 vs. 0.89), and lifestyle (median score: 1.1 vs. 0.33). Hemorrhage and abdominal/rectal pain did not improve significantly. The odds ratios for advantage of Aloe vera over placebo for ""clinical presentation total"" and ""RTOG total"" were 3.97 (1.3-11.9) and 5.9 (1.6-21.6), respectively. CONCLUSION: A substantial number of patients with radiation proctitis seem to benefit from therapy with Aloe vera 3% ointment."	2b
23341418	Massage for perioperative pain and anxiety in placement of vascular access devices.	CONTEXT: Despite major advances in cancer treatment, many patients undergo painful procedures during treatment and suffer debilitating side effects as well as report a decrease in quality of life (QOL). This problem is exacerbated for low-income, racial, and ethnic minorities with cancer. Minority cancer patients often enter care with larger tumors and with a more aggressive disease, increasing the risk of debilitating symptoms, such as pain and anxiety. Researchers have never assessed the feasibility and effectiveness of offering massage therapy for low-income, underserved cancer patients who are undergoing port insertion. OBJECTIVE: This study examined the feasibility of conducting a randomized, controlled trial (RCT) that would assess the use of massage therapy to reduce pain and anxiety in urban patients with cancer who undergo surgical placement of a vascular access device (port). The study also assessed the effectiveness of the intervention in reducing perioperative pain and anxiety. DESIGN: The research team conducted a 9-month RC T of 60 cancer patients undergoing port placement. The research team randomly assigned patients in a 2:1 ratio to usual care with massage therapy (intervention group) versus usual care with structured attention (control group). SETTING: The study took place at Boston Medical Center (BMC), which is an urban, tertiary-referral, safety-net hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Participants were cancer patients undergoing port placement. Sixty-seven percent were racial or ethnic minorities, and the majority were female and unemployed, with annual household incomes <$30 000 and publicly funded health insurance coverage. INTERVENTION: For the intervention, an expert panel developed a reproducible, standardized massage therapy intended for individuals undergoing surgical port insertion. Both groups received 20-minute interventions immediately pre- and postsurgery. The research team collected data on pain and anxiety before and after the preoperative and postoperative interventions as well as 1 day after the surgery. OUTCOME MEASURES: With respect to feasibility, the study examined (1) data about recruitment--time to complete enrollment and proportion of racial and ethnic minorities enrolled; (2) participants' retention; and (3) adherence to treatment allocation. The efficacy outcomes included measuring (1) participants' average pain level using an 11-point numerical rating scale (0 = no pain to 10 = worst possible pain) and (2) participants' situational anxiety using the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). RESULTS: The research team assigned the 60 patients to the groups over 53 weeks. Sixty-seven percent of the participants were racial or ethnic minorities. A majority were female and unemployed, with annual household incomes <$30 000 and publicly funded health insurance coverage. Of the 40 patients allocated to massage therapy, the majority (n = 33) received both the pre- and postoperative interventions. Massage therapy participants had a statistically significant, greater reduction in anxiety after the first intervention compared with individuals receiving structured attention (-10.27 vs -5.21, P = .0037). CONCLUSIONS: Recruitment of low-income, minority patients into an RCT of massage therapy for perioperative pain and anxiety is feasible. Both massage therapy and structured attention proved beneficial for alleviating preoperative anxiety in cancer patients undergoing port placement.	2b
20690197	Comparative risk-adjusted mortality outcomes after primary surgery, radiotherapy, or androgen-deprivation therapy for localized prostate cancer.	BACKGROUND: Because no adequate randomized trials have compared active treatment modalities for localized prostate cancer, the authors analyzed risk-adjusted, cancer-specific mortality outcomes among men who underwent radical prostatectomy, men who received external-beam radiation therapy, and men who received primary androgen-deprivation therapy. METHODS: The Cancer of the Prostate Strategic Urologic Research Endeavor (CaPSURE) registry comprises men from 40 urologic practice sites who are followed prospectively under uniform protocols, regardless of treatment. In the current study, 7538 men with localized disease were analyzed. Prostate cancer risk was assessed using the Kattan preoperative nomogram and the Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment (CAPRA) score, both well validated instruments that are calculated from clinical data at the time of diagnosis. A parametric survival model was constructed to compare outcomes across treatments adjusting for risk and age. RESULTS: In total, 266 men died of prostate cancer during follow-up. Adjusting for age and risk, the hazard ratio for cancer-specific mortality relative to prostatectomy was 2.21 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.50-3.24) for radiation therapy and 3.22 (95% CI, 2.16-4.81) for androgen deprivation. Absolute differences between prostatectomy and radiation therapy were small for men at low risk but increased substantially for men at intermediate and high risk. These results were robust to a variety of different analytic techniques, including competing risks regression analysis, adjustment by CAPRA score rather than Kattan score, and examination of overall survival as the endpoint. CONCLUSIONS: Prostatectomy for localized prostate cancer was associated with a significant and substantial reduction in mortality relative to radiation therapy and androgen-deprivation monotherapy. Although this was not a randomized study, given the multiple adjustments and sensitivity analyses, it is unlikely that unmeasured confounding would account for the large observed differences in survival.	2b
12789464	Randomized phase III trial of postoperative radiochemotherapy +/- amifostine in head and neck cancer. Is there evidence for radioprotection?	PURPOSE: Experimental and clinical data suggest a reduction of radiation-induced acute toxicity by amifostine (A). We investigated this issue in a randomized trial comparing radiochemotherapy (RT + CT) versus radiochemotherapy plus amifostine (RC + CT + A) in patients with head and neck cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 56 patients with oro-/hypopharynx or larynx cancer (T1-2 N1-2 G3, T3-4 N0-2 G1-3) were randomized to receive RC + CT alone or RC + CT + A. Patients were irradiated up to 60 Gy (R0) or 70 Gy (R1/2) and received chemotherapy (70 mg/m(2) carboplatin, day 1-5 in week 1 and 5 of radiotherapy). 250 mg amifostine were applied daily before each radiotherapy session. Acute toxicity was evaluated according to the Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC). As for acute xerostomia, patients with laryngeal cancer were excluded from evaluation. RESULTS: 50 patients were evaluable (25 patients in the RC + CT, 25 patients in the RC + CT + A group). Clinical characteristics were well balanced in both treatment groups. Amifostine provided reduction in acute xerostomia and mucositis but had no obvious influence on Karnofsky performance status, body weight, cutaneous side effects, and alopecia. The differences between both groups were statistically significant for acute xerostomia and nonsignificant, but with a trend for mucositis. CONCLUSIONS: According to our results, there is a radioprotective effect on salivary glands and a potential effect on oral mucosa by amifostine in postoperative radiotherapy combined with carboplatin. To improve the radio- and chemoprotective effects of amifostine in clinical practice, the application of a higher dose (> 250 mg) seems to be necessary.	2b
30190887	Outcomes and toxicity of stereotactic radiosurgery for melanoma brain metastases in patients receiving ipilimumab.	Purpose: Patients with melanoma treated with ipilimumab and radiosurgery (stereotactic radiosurgery [SRS]) were reviewed for efficacy/safety. Methods: Patients who received ipilimumab and SRS for brain metastases were analyzed for control of SRS-treated metastasis and overall survival. Results: We identified 27 patients, 26 were assessable for outcomes. Median time-to-treated metastasis progression was 6.3 months (95% CI: 3.1-12.2). Overall survival was 23.4 months (95% CI: 5.7-not estimable) for SRS prior to/during ipilimumab (n = 14), and 10.4 months (95% CI: 1.9-not estimable) for SRS after ipilimumab (n = 12). Overall, no unexpected toxicities were seen: 11% of patients experienced grade 3 CNS toxicity and 7% developed radionecrosis. Conclusion: SRS for melanoma brain metastases with ipilimumab was well-tolerated. There may be improved survival for patients receiving SRS prior to/during ipilimumab.	3b
16112300	Direct decompressive surgical resection in the treatment of spinal cord compression caused by metastatic cancer: a randomised trial.	BACKGROUND: The standard treatment for spinal cord compression caused by metastatic cancer is corticosteroids and radiotherapy. The role of surgery has not been established. We assessed the efficacy of direct decompressive surgery. METHODS: In this randomised, multi-institutional, non-blinded trial, we randomly assigned patients with spinal cord compression caused by metastatic cancer to either surgery followed by radiotherapy (n=50) or radiotherapy alone (n=51). Radiotherapy for both treatment groups was given in ten 3 Gy fractions. The primary endpoint was the ability to walk. Secondary endpoints were urinary continence, muscle strength and functional status, the need for corticosteroids and opioid analgesics, and survival time. All analyses were by intention to treat. FINDINGS: After an interim analysis the study was stopped because the criterion of a predetermined early stopping rule was met. Thus, 123 patients were assessed for eligibility before the study closed and 101 were randomised. Significantly more patients in the surgery group (42/50, 84%) than in the radiotherapy group (29/51, 57%) were able to walk after treatment (odds ratio 6.2 [95% CI 2.0-19.8] p=0.001). Patients treated with surgery also retained the ability to walk significantly longer than did those with radiotherapy alone (median 122 days vs 13 days, p=0.003). 32 patients entered the study unable to walk; significantly more patients in the surgery group regained the ability to walk than patients in the radiation group (10/16 [62%] vs 3/16 [19%], p=0.01). The need for corticosteroids and opioid analgesics was significantly reduced in the surgical group. INTERPRETATION: Direct decompressive surgery plus postoperative radiotherapy is superior to treatment with radiotherapy alone for patients with spinal cord compression caused by metastatic cancer.	1a
17943832	Intermittent versus continuous androgen suppression for prostatic cancer.	BACKGROUND: After lung cancer, prostate cancer is the most common cause of death among males. The aim of treatment is to prevent disease-related morbidity and mortality while minimizing intervention-related adverse events. Androgen suppression therapy (AST) to reduce circulating serum testosterone and disease progression is considered a mainstay of treatment for men with advanced prostate cancer. It has been increasingly utilized for early stage disease despite a lack of evidence of effectiveness. OBJECTIVES: Evaluate the effectiveness and safety of intermittent androgen suppression (IAS) compared to continuous androgen suppression for treating prostatic cancer. SEARCH STRATEGY: The following databases were searched to identify randomised or quasi-randomised, controlled trials comparing intermittent and continuous androgen suppression in the treatment of any stage of prostate cancer: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials; EMBASE and LILACS. SELECTION CRITERIA: Studies were included if they were randomised or quasi-randomized, and compare the effects of IAS versus CAS. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two reviewers selected relevant trials, assessed methodological quality and extracted data. MAIN RESULTS: Five randomized studies involving 1382 patients were included in this review. All the included studies involved advanced (T3 or T4) prostate cancer, had relatively small populations, and were of short duration. Few events were reported and did not assess disease-specific survival or metastatic disease. Only one study (N = 77) evaluated biochemical outcomes. A subgroup analysis found no significant differences in biochemical progression (defined by the authors as PSA >/= 10 ng/mL) between IAS and CAS for Gleason scores 4 - 6, 7, and 8 - 10. For patients with a Gleason score > 6, reduction in biochemical progression favoured the IAS group (RR 0.10, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.67, P = 0.02). Studies primarily reported on adverse events. One trial (N = 43) found no difference in adverse effects (gastrointestinal, gynecomastia and asthenia) between IAS ( two events) and CAS (five events), with the exception of impotence, which was significantly lower in the IAS group (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.92, P = 0.008). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Data from RCTs comparing IAS to CAS are limited by small sample size and short duration. There are no data for the relative effectiveness of IAS versus CAS for overall survival, prostate cancer-specific survival, or disease progression. Limited information suggests IAS may have slightly reduced adverse events. Overall, IAS was also as effective as CAS for potency, but was superior during the interval of cycles (96%).	1a
1897368	[Use of CO2 laser in conservative surgery of glottic tumors].	The present work evaluates the results obtained in a group of 360 patients with laryngeal-glottic tumors (classification T1/T2-N0-M0) who, in the last 10 years, have undergone direct microlaryngoscopy surgery employing a CO2 Laser. In the T1 glottic carcinomas the neoplasm was limited to the vocal cord on one side or it involved the anterior commissure and, most likely, the vocal cord on the opposite side; in T2 glottic tumors the extension reached the hypoglottic region and/or the Morgagni ventricle and the false vocal cords on one or both sides but without compromising laryngeal motility. The five year healing rate for the T1 tumors proved to be 84.7% while it was 74% for the T2 forms. In 36 cases complications were found which can be broken down as follows: - limited local recurrences (13 patients) requiring subsequent direct microlaryngoscopy; - regional lymph node metastases (6 patients) without reproduction of the primary neoplasm; in general (5 of the 6 cases) these patients underwent lateral neck dissection; - spreading of the neoplastic process (17 cases) which made total laryngectomy with lateral neck dissection necessary; this procedure was performed in 15 cases. When these subsequent surgical procedures are also taken into account the percentage healing rises to 94.3% for T1 glottic tumors and to 84.9% for T2. Detailed analysis of the case study, comparison with the data found in the relative literature regarding patients treated with traditional techniques, a series of observations on the advantages and disadvantages inherent to the techniques employed have all led to the conclusion that the use of a CO2 laser in the treatment of laryngeal tumors gives excellent results in terms of prognosis. Moreover, this technique offers significant advantages over the traditional methods and constitutes a reliable technique for partial laryngectomies as long as the indications are accurately applied and the proper techniques used.	4
17896141	Impact of total lymph node count and lymph node ratio on staging and survival after pancreatectomy for pancreatic adenocarcinoma: a large, population-based analysis.	BACKGROUND: Based on data from other malignancies, the number of lymph nodes evaluated and the ratio of metastatic to examined lymph nodes (LNR) may be important predictors of survival. LNR has never been investigated in a large population-based study of patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma. METHODS: The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database was used to identify 4005 patients who underwent resection for pancreatic adenocarcinoma from 1988 to 2003. The effect of total lymph node count and LNR on survival was examined using univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: The median number of lymph nodes examined was seven; 390 (10.1%) patients had no lymph nodes examined. Of those patients who had at least one lymph node examined, 1507 (43.3%) had no lymph node metastases (N0) and 1971 (56.7%) had metastatic nodal disease (N1). Overall median survival was 13 months, and 5-year survival was 6.8%. N1 disease was associated with a worse 5-year survival compared with N0 disease (4.3 vs 11.3%, respectively, P < .001). Patients with N0 disease could be further stratified based on the number of lymph nodes evaluated (median survival: 1-11 nodes, 16 months vs 12 or more nodes, 23 months; P < .001). For N1 patients, LNR was one of the most powerful factors associated with survival (LNR > 0-0.2, 15 months; LNR > 0.2-0.4, 12 months; LNR > 0.4, 10 months) (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Most patients have an inadequate number of lymph nodes evaluated following pancreatic surgery. N0 patients who have fewer than 12 lymph nodes examined may be understaged. In patients with N1 disease, LNR may better substratify patients with regard to prognosis.	2b
17001589	A literature review of randomized controlled trials of the organization of care at the end of life.	We searched nine electronic databases for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) about care at the end of life and found 23 RCTs. We assessed their quality using the criteria of the Cochrane Collaboration. The RCTs researched three themes: (a) the effect of providing palliative care through dedicated community teams on quality of life, on the management of symptoms, on satisfaction with care, on the duration of the palliative period, and on place of death; (b) the effects of specific palliative care interventions-advanced planning of care for the end of life, patient-held records, providing quality-of-life data to patients and physicians, grief education for relatives, palliative care education for nurses, and palliative care for patients with dementia; and (c) the costs of palliative compared to conventional care. We identify difficulties in conducting research on palliative care and solutions and discuss future possible research themes.	1a
21738340	Clinical implications of immunohistochemically demonstrated lymph node micrometastasis in resectable pancreatic cancer.	The purpose of this study was to determine the clinical significance of nodal micrometastasis detected by immunohistochemistry in patients that had undergone curative surgery for pancreatic cancer. Between 2005 and 2006, a total of 208 lymph nodes from 48 consecutive patients with pancreatic cancer that had undergone curative resection were immunostained with monoclonal antibody against pan-ck and CK-19. Micrometastasis was defined as metastasis missed by a routine H&E examination but detected during an immunohistochemical evaluation. Relations between immunohistochemical results and clinical and pathologic features and patient survival were examined. Nodal micrometastases were detected in 5 (29.4%) patients of 17 pN0 patients. Nodal micrometastasis was found to be related to tumor relapse (P = 0.043). Twelve patients without overt nodal metastasis and micrometastasis had better prognosis than 5 patients with only nodal micrometastasis (median survival; 35.9 vs 8.6 months, P < 0.001). The Cox proportional hazard model identified nodal micrometastasis as significant prognostic factors. Although the number of patients with micrometastasis was so small and further study would be needed, our study suggests that the lymph node micrometastasis could be the predictor of worse survival and might indicate aggressive tumor biology among patients undergoing curative resection for pancreas cancer.	4
18607876	A phase II study of thalidomide in patients with brain metastases from malignant melanoma.	INTRODUCTION: Brain metastases develop in nearly half of the patients with advanced melanoma and in 15 to 20% of these patients CNS is the first site of relapse. Overall median survival is short, ranging from 2 to 4 months. Thalidomide has antiangiogenic and immunomodulatory effects. Results obtained in prior trials indicate that Thalidomide acts as a cytostatic agent in metastatic melanoma. We evaluated single agent antitumour activity and toxicity of Thalidomide in a phase II setting in patients with brain metastases associated with metastatic melanoma. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Patients with measurable metastatic melanoma in progression and with PS < or = 2 were enrolled in the study. Thalidomide was given orally. Dose was escalated over 4 weeks from 100 mg/day to 400 mg/day. Primary objective of the study was to determine response rate, according to RECIST. Secondary objectives were to estimate time to progression, overall survival and to evaluate tolerability of the regimen. RESULTS: Twenty five men and 11 women were enrolled in the study, median age 48 years. Among 36 eligible patients 35 were evaluable for response. None of the patients obtained a response in brain metastases. Three patients obtained a partial response in extracranial lesions. Toxicity was acceptable and manageably. Median time to progression and overall survival time was 1.7 and 3.1 months, respectively. CONCLUSION: There were no objective responses in the brain but single agent Thalidomide has some activity in melanoma patients with brain metastases. It has encouraged us to investigate Thalidomide in combination with Temozolomide, a very lipophilic agent, in this group of patients.	4
26893783	Real-world efficacy, toxicity and clinical management of ipilimumab treatment in metastatic melanoma.	"Approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2011, the anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 checkpoint inhibitor ipilimumab has delivered a survival benefit of >/=3 years in a subset of metastatic melanoma patients. After participating in the registration trial, patients were treated with this agent in routine practice. Toxicity and efficacy of agents in ""real world"" settings may differ from trials. The present study aimed to evaluate, with respect to toxicity and outcome, all patients treated with ipilimumab to date at the Princess Margaret Hospital (Toronto, Canada). Patients treated with ipilimumab between 2008 and 2013 were identified, and patient characteristics (age, gender, tumour burden, oncogenic mutation status, number of treatments received and toxicities from treatment) were collected. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were calculated from the commencement of ipilimumab treatment. Associations between clinical characteristics and outcome or toxicity were assessed. Between 2008 and 2013, 129 patients with metastatic cutaneous melanoma were treated. Since, during this period, ipilimumab was approved in the second line setting, ipilimumab was delivered in the second or subsequent line in all patients, and 70% did not receive any further anticancer therapy. Immune-related toxicities were observed, the onset of which varied from 1 to 162 days. The majority resolved within 6 weeks of the final treatment, with the exception of endocrinopathies and bowel related toxicity. The median PFS and OS were 2.83 and 8.44 months, respectively. No pre-treatment factor independently predicted toxicity. The number of infusions (4 vs. </=3) and presence of toxicity were significantly associated with superior survival. The onset of toxicity secondary to ipilimumab could occur later than previously reported. Toxicities were manageable, but required long-term vigilance."	3a
25562436	Childhood body mass index in relation to future risk of oesophageal adenocarcinoma.	BACKGROUND: Middle-aged obese adults are at substantially elevated risk of oesophageal adenocarcinoma. It is unclear whether this risk originates earlier in life. METHODS: We assessed associations between childhood body mass index (BMI) and height-measured annually between ages 7 and 13-with adult oesophageal adenocarcinoma in a cohort from the Copenhagen School Health Records Register. Analyses included 255 053 children born during 1930-1971. Danish Cancer Registry linkage provided outcomes. We calculated hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using Cox proportional hazards regression. RESULTS: During 5.4 million person-years of follow-up, 254 (216 males) incident oesophageal adenocarcinomas occurred. At each examined age, cancer risk increased linearly per unit BMI z-score, although associations were only statistically significant for ages 9-13. The HR for the age of 13 years was 1.31 (95% CI: 1.13, 1.51) per unit BMI z-score. Associations were similar in men and women and across birth cohorts. Childhood height was not related to cancer risk in men but was in women, although these analyses included just 38 female cases. HRs per unit height z-score at the age of 13 years were 1.04 (0.90, 1.19) in males and 1.77 (1.27, 2.47) in females, with similar results observed at the other examined ages. CONCLUSION: Individuals with higher childhood BMI were at elevated risk of oesophageal adenocarcinoma, even though these cancers occurred many decades later in life. Although the mechanisms require further investigation, our findings provide additional evidence for the long-term health risks of childhood obesity.	2b
26629425	Immune checkpoint inhibitors in clinical practice: update on management of immune-related toxicities.	Immune checkpoint blockade using inhibitors of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) and programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) has shown clinically significant antitumor response and has been approved for the treatment of malignant melanoma and squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). These immunotherapies are associated with unique set of toxicities termed immune-related adverse events (irAEs) that are very different from toxicities observed with conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy. Prompt recognition and initiation of appropriate management, usually in the form of immunosuppression, usually results in complete reversibility, but failing to do so can lead to severe toxicity or even death. Clinical algorithms describing the management of common irAEs have been published based on clinical trial information and experience in metastatic melanoma with ipilimumab, a human IgG1 monoclonal antibody that binds to CTLA-4 and blocks T cell inhibition. The most common irAEs reported with ipilimumab are dermatologic toxicity, diarrhea/colitis, hepatotoxicity, and endocrinopathies, although other sites can also be affected. Similar irAEs have been observed with agents targeting PD-1. Nivolumab and pembrolizumab are humanized monoclonal antibodies that bind to PD-1 and prevent T cell inactivation. Ipilimumab, pembrolizumab, and nivolumab are approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of advanced melanoma; nivolumab was also recently approved for metastatic squamous NSCLC. This review describes the optimal management of toxicities related to immune checkpoint inhibition from FDA-approved agents targeting CTLA-4 and PD-1.	3a
27083774	Is suicide assessment harmful to participants? Findings from a randomized controlled trial.	There is considerable debate on whether suicide assessment carries an iatrogenic risk for participants/patients. A double-blind randomized controlled trial (registration: R000022314) tested the emotional impact of suicide assessment on participants (n = 259) randomly assigned to experimental (n = 122) or control conditions (n = 137). The experimental condition included the Suicidal Affect-Behavior-Cognition Scale and intensive death-related questions, the control condition a quality of life scale. Both included measures of depression, social support and loneliness. Affective states were assessed immediately before and after testing, and research biases minimized. Post-test debriefing interviews collected qualitative reactions. Experimental participants ranged from nonsuicidal to highly suicidal. Between-groups ANCOVAs and repeated measures ANOVAs showed no differences by study condition, and no pre-post-test affect changes for either condition or suicidal participants (P > 0.10), supporting the null hypothesis of no iatrogenic effects. However, depressive participants in both conditions showed significant decreases in positive affect (P < 0.05). Smallest real difference (SRD) scores approximated clinically meaningful differences and showed 20% of participants had a significant positive survey reaction, 24% a negative reaction, with the rest neutral. Linear regressions revealed depressive symptoms and perceived family support, but not suicidality or other factors, predicted negative affect changes, which was supported by qualitative findings. Social desirability bias was also found in qualitative survey responses. No evidence of iatrogenic effects of suicide assessment were found. Recommendations are made to counter possible negative assessment effects on depressive participants/patients, and nurses and other caregivers are encouraged to talk to patients about suicidal symptoms.	1b
27565426	A preliminary randomised controlled study of short-term Antrodia cinnamomea treatment combined with chemotherapy for patients with advanced cancer.	BACKGROUND: Antrodia cinnamomea (AC) is a popular medicinal mushroom in Taiwan that has been widely used for treatment of various cancers. Few clinical studies have reported its application and efficiency in therapeutic chemotherapy strategies. We performed a double-blind, randomized clinical study to investigate whether AC given for 30 days had acceptable safety and efficacy in advanced cancer patients receiving chemotherapy. METHODS: Patients with advanced and/or metastatic adenocarcinoma, performance status (PS) 0-2, and adequate organ function who had previously been treated with standard chemotherapy were randomly assigned to receive routine chemotherapy regimens with AC (20 ml twice daily) orally for 30 days or placebo. The primary endpoint was 6-month overall survival (OS); the secondary endpoints were disease control rate (DCR), quality of life (QoL), adverse event (AE), and biochemical features within 30 days of treatment. RESULTS: From August 2010 to July 2012, 37 subjects with gastric, lung, liver, breast, and colorectal cancer (17 in the AC group, 20 in the placebo group) were enrolled in the study. Disease progression was the primary cause of death in 4 (33.3 %) AC and 8 (66.7 %) placebo recipients. Mean OSs were 5.4 months for the AC group and 5.0 months for the placebo group (p = 0.340), and the DCRs were 41.2 and 55 %, respectively (p = 0.33). Most hematologic, liver, or kidney functions did not differ significantly between the two groups, but platelet counts were lower in the AC group than in the placebo group (p = 0.02). QoL assessments were similar in the two groups, except that the AC group showed significant improvements in quality of sleep (p = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Although we found a lower mortality rate and longer mean OS in the AC group than in the control group, A. cinnamomea combined with chemotherapy was not shown to improve the outcome of advanced cancer patients, possibly due to the small sample size. In fact, the combination may present a potential risk of lowered platelet counts. Adequately powered clinical trials will be necessary to address this question. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01287286 .	2b
11597795	Randomized trial addressing risk features and time factors of surgery plus radiotherapy in advanced head-and-neck cancer.	PURPOSE: A multi-institutional, prospective, randomized trial was undertaken in patients with advanced head-and-neck squamous cell carcinoma to address (1) the validity of using pathologic risk features, established from a previous study, to determine the need for, and dose of, postoperative radiotherapy (PORT); (2) the impact of accelerating PORT using a concomitant boost schedule; and (3) the importance of the overall combined treatment duration on the treatment outcome. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Of 288 consecutive patients with advanced disease registered preoperatively, 213 fulfilled the trial criteria and went on to receive therapy predicated on a set of pathologic risk features: no PORT for the low-risk group (n = 31); 57.6 Gy during 6.5 weeks for the intermediate-risk group (n = 31); and, by random assignment, 63 Gy during 5 weeks (n = 76) or 7 weeks (n = 75) for the high-risk group. Patients were irradiated with standard techniques appropriate to the site of disease and likely areas of spread. The study end points were locoregional control (LRC), survival, and morbidity. RESULTS: Patients with low or intermediate risks had significantly higher LRC and survival rates than those with high-risk features (p = 0.003 and p = 0.0001, respectively), despite receiving no PORT or lower dose PORT, respectively. For high-risk patients, a trend toward higher LRC and survival rates was noted when PORT was delivered in 5 rather than 7 weeks. A prolonged interval between surgery and PORT in the 7-week schedule was associated with significantly lower LRC (p = 0.03) and survival (p = 0.01) rates. Consequently, the cumulative duration of combined therapy had a significant impact on the LRC (p = 0.005) and survival (p = 0.03) rates. A 2-week reduction in the PORT duration by using the concomitant boost technique did not increase the late treatment toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: This Phase III trial established the power of risk assessment using pathologic features in determining the need for, and dose of, PORT in patients with advanced head-and-neck squamous cell cancer in a prospective, multi-institutional setting. It also revealed the impact of the overall treatment time in the combination of surgery and PORT on the outcome in high-risk patients and showed that PORT acceleration without a reduction in dose by a concomitant boost regimen did not increase the late complication rate. These findings emphasize the importance of coordinated interdisciplinary care in the delivery of combined surgery and RT.	1b
20458210	Phase II and coagulation cascade biomarker study of bevacizumab with or without docetaxel in patients with previously treated metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma.	PURPOSE: Treatment options are limited for advanced pancreatic cancer progressive after gemcitabine therapy. The vascular endothelial growth factor pathway is biologically important in pancreatic cancer, and docetaxel has modest antitumor activity. We evaluated the role of the anti-vascular endothelial growth factor antibody bevacizumab as second-line treatment for patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer. DESIGN: Patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas who had progressive disease on a gemcitabine-containing regimen were randomized to receive bevacizumab alone or bevacizumab in combination with docetaxel. RESULTS: Thirty-two patients were enrolled; 16 to bevacizumab alone (Arm A) and 16 to bevacizumab plus docetaxel (Arm B). Toxicities were greater in Arm B with the most common grade 3/4 nonhematologic toxicities including fatigue, diarrhea, dehydration, and anorexia. No confirmed objective responses were observed. At 4 months, 2 of the 16 patients in Arm A and 3 of the 16 patients in Arm B were free from progression. The study was stopped according to the early stopping rule for futility. Median progression-free survival and overall survival were 43 days and 165 days in Arm A and 48 days and 125 days in Arm B. Elevated d-dimer levels and thrombin-antithrombin complexes were associated with decreased survival and increased toxicity. CONCLUSION: Bevacizumab with or without docetaxel does not have antitumor activity in gemcitabine-refractory metastatic pancreatic cancer. Baseline and on-treatment d-dimer and thrombin-antithrombin complex levels are associated with increased toxicity and decreased survival.	2b
26826051	Concordance of handheld reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) with histopathology in the diagnosis of lentigo maligna (LM): A prospective study.	BACKGROUND: Reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) provides real-time noninvasive imaging of cell structure and may be useful in diagnosing lentigo maligna (LM). Few studies have compared performance of RCM with histopathology in diagnosing LM, and specific features influencing RCM interpretation are not well described. OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine concordance rate between RCM and histopathology in the evaluation of suspected LM and to identify factors that may obscure diagnosis. METHODS: We designed a prospective study involving 17 participants seen for evaluation at a large tertiary referral center. Cases included primary lesions and possible recurrent and/or previously treated lesions. A total of 63 clinically equivocal sites were assessed by RCM and histopathology. RESULTS: RCM and histopathology interpretations were concordant in 56 of 63 sites (89%). There were no false-negative and 7 false-positive results using RCM (sensitivity 100%, specificity 71%, positive predictive value 85%, negative predictive value 100%). Features suggestive of LM in the false-positive group included the presence of numerous hyperreflectile large cells at the dermoepidermal junction and follicular localization of these cells. LIMITATIONS: A larger test set is needed to more reliably distinguish LM from benign lesions using RCM and to improve specificity. CONCLUSION: RCM shows excellent sensitivity for detecting LM although features of benign macules on a background of actinically damaged skin can obscure diagnosis and limit its specificity.	2b
28187044	Minimally Invasive Versus Open Esophageal Resection: Three-year Follow-up of the Previously Reported Randomized Controlled Trial: the TIME Trial.	OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate 3-year survival following a randomized controlled trial comparing minimally invasive with open esophagectomy in patients with esophageal cancer. BACKGROUND: Research on minimally invasive esophagectomy (MIE) has shown faster postoperative recovery and a marked decrease in pulmonary complications. Debate is ongoing as to whether the procedure is equivalent to open resection regarding oncologic outcomes. The study is a follow-up study of the TIME-trial (traditional invasive vs minimally invasive esophagectomy, a multicenter, randomized trial). METHODS: Between June 2009 and March 2011, patients with a resectable intrathoracic esophageal carcinoma, including the gastroesophageal junction tumors (Siewert I), were randomized between open and MI esophagectomy with curative intent. Primary outcome was 3-year disease-free survival. Secondary outcomes include overall survival, lymph node yield, short-term morbidity, mortality, complications, radicality, local recurrence, and metastasis. Analysis was by intention-to-treat. This trial is registered with the Netherlands Trial Register, NTR TC 2452. Both trial protocol and short-term results have been published previously. RESULTS: One hundred fifteen patients were included from 5 European hospitals and randomly assigned to open (n = 56) or MI esophagectomy (n = 59). Combined overall 3-year survival was 40.4% (SD 7.7%) in the open group versus 50.5% (SD 8%) in the minimally invasive group (P = 0.207). The hazard ratio (HR) is 0.883 (0.540 to 1.441) for MIE compared with open surgery. Disease-free 3-year survival was 35.9% (SD 6.8%) in the open versus 40.2% (SD 6.9%) in the MI group [HR 0.691 (0.389 to 1.239). CONCLUSIONS: The study presented here depicted no differences in disease-free and overall 3-year survival for open and MI esophagectomy. These results, together with short-term results, further support the use of minimally invasive surgical techniques in the treatment of esophageal cancer.	1b
27145355	Feasibility, acceptability and preliminary psychological benefits of mindfulness meditation training in a sample of men diagnosed with prostate cancer on active surveillance: results from a randomized controlled pilot trial.	OBJECTIVE: In a pilot randomized controlled trial, examine the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of an 8-week, mindfulness training program (Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction) in a sample of men on active surveillance on important psychological outcomes including prostate cancer anxiety, uncertainty intolerance and posttraumatic growth. METHODS: Men were randomized to either mindfulness (n = 24) or an attention control arm (n = 19) and completed self-reported measures of prostate cancer anxiety, uncertainty intolerance, global quality of life, mindfulness and posttraumatic growth at baseline, 8 weeks, 6 months and 12 months. RESULTS: Participants in the mindfulness arm demonstrated significant decreases in prostate cancer anxiety and uncertainty intolerance, and significant increases in mindfulness, global mental health and posttraumatic growth. Participants in the control condition also demonstrated significant increases in mindfulness over time. Longitudinal increases in posttraumatic growth were significantly larger in the mindfulness arm than they were in the control arm. CONCLUSIONS: While mindfulness training was found to be generally feasible and acceptable among participants who enrolled in the 8-week intervention as determined by completion rates and open-ended survey responses, the response rate between initial enrollment and the total number of men approached was lower than desired (47%). While larger sample sizes are necessary to examine the efficacy of mindfulness training on important psychological outcomes, in this pilot study posttraumatic growth was shown to significantly increase over time for men in the treatment group. Mindfulness training has the potential to help men cope more effectively with some of the stressors and uncertainties associated with active surveillance.

17452930	Proactive palliative care in the medical intensive care unit: effects on length of stay for selected high-risk patients.	OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of proactive palliative care consultation on length of stay for high-risk patients in the medical intensive care unit (MICU). DESIGN: A prospective pre/post nonequivalent control group design was used for this performance improvement study. SETTING: Seventeen-bed adult MICU. PATIENTS: Of admissions to the MICU, 191 patients were identified as having a serious illness and at high risk of dying: 65 patients in the usual care phase and 126 patients in the proactive palliative care phase. To be included in the sample, a patient had to meet one of the following criteria: a) intensive care admission following a current hospital stay of >or=10 days; b) age >80 yrs in the presence of two or more life-threatening comorbidities (e.g., end-stage renal disease, severe congestive heart failure); c) diagnosis of an active stage IV malignancy; d) status post cardiac arrest; or e) diagnosis of an intracerebral hemorrhage requiring mechanical ventilation. INTERVENTIONS: Palliative care consultations. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Primary measures were patient lengths of stay a) for the entire hospitalization; b) in the MICU; and c) from MICU admission to hospital discharge. Secondary measures included mortality rates and discharge disposition. There were no significant differences between the usual care and proactive palliative care intervention groups in respect to age, gender, race, screening criteria, discharge disposition, or mortality. Patients in the proactive palliative care group had significantly shorter lengths of stay in the MICU (8.96 vs. 16.28 days, p = .0001). There were no differences between the two groups on total length of stay in the hospital or length of stay from MICU admission to hospital discharge. CONCLUSIONS: Proactive palliative care consultation was associated with a significantly shorter MICU length of stay in this high-risk group without any significant differences in mortality rates or discharge disposition.	2a
19805683	Phase III trial of casopitant, a novel neurokinin-1 receptor antagonist, for the prevention of nausea and vomiting in patients receiving moderately emetogenic chemotherapy.	PURPOSE: The purpose of this phase III trial was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of regimens containing casopitant, a novel neurokinin-1 receptor antagonist, for the prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting during the first cycle in patients receiving moderately emetogenic chemotherapy (MEC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Predominantly female patients (98%) diagnosed with breast cancer (96%) who were chemotherapy-naive and scheduled to receive an anthracycline and cyclophosphamide (AC) -based regimen were enrolled onto this multinational, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled clinical trial. All patients received dexamethasone 8 mg intravenously (IV) on day 1 and oral ondansetron 8 mg twice daily on days 1 to 3. Patients were randomly assigned to a control arm (placebo), a single oral dose casopitant arm (150 mg orally [PO] on day 1), a 3-day oral casopitant arm (150 mg PO on day 1 plus 50 mg PO on days 2 to 3), or a 3-day IV/oral casopitant arm (90 mg IV on day 1 plus 50 mg PO on days 2 to 3). The primary end point was the proportion of patients achieving complete response (no vomiting/retching or rescue medications) in the first 120 hours after the initiation of MEC. RESULTS: A significantly greater proportion of patients in the single-dose oral casopitant arm, 3-day oral casopitant arm, and 3-day IV/oral casopitant arm achieved complete response (73%, 73%, and 74%, respectively) versus control (59%; P < .0001). The study did not demonstrate a reduced proportion of patients with nausea or significant nausea in those receiving casopitant. Adverse events were balanced among study arms. CONCLUSION: All casopitant regimens studied were more effective than the control regimen. Casopitant was generally well tolerated.	1a
29198334	Mind and body practices for fatigue reduction in patients with cancer and hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients: A systematic review and meta-analysis.	PURPOSE: To determine whether non-physical activity mind and body practices reduce the severity of fatigue in patients with cancer or hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients compared to control interventions. METHODS: We included randomized trials which compared non-physical activity mind and body practices compared with control interventions for the management of fatigue in cancer and HSCT patients. RESULTS: Among 55 trials (4975 patients), interventions were acupuncture or acupressure (n=12), mindfulness (n=11), relaxation techniques (n=10), massage (n=6), energy therapy (n=5), energizing yogic breathing (n=3) and others (n=8). When combined, all interventions significantly reduced fatigue severity compared to all controls (standardized mean difference -0.51, 95% confidence interval -0.73 to -0.29). More specifically, mindfulness and relaxation significantly reduced fatigue severity. CONCLUSIONS: Mindfulness and relaxation were effective at reducing fatigue severity in patients with cancer and HSCT recipients. Future studies should evaluate how to translate these findings into clinical practice across different patient groups.	2a
22777411	An observational study of insomnia and nightmare treated with trazodone in patients with advanced cancer.	Patients with cancer often experience insomnia. Nightmares are also a strong factor that interferes with the maintenance of comfortable and satisfying sleep. However, the prevalence and standard treatment of nightmares in patients with cancer have not been established yet. We aimed to treat insomnia and nightmares with trazodone. From 2008 to 2011, trazodone was prescribed to 30 patients with cancer who reported experiencing insomnia with or without nightmares to the palliative care team in Osaka University Hospital. Effective treatment was seen in 15 patients (50%). Four patients with cancer reported having severe nightmares and 2 patients had beneficial effects, with frightening dreams transformed into acceptable ones. Trazodone may be an effective drug for the treatment of insomnia and nightmares in patients with advanced cancer.	3a
21167528	Influence of pretreatment and treatment factors on intermediate to long-term outcome after prostate brachytherapy.	PURPOSE: We describe how treatment factors influence biochemical freedom from failure, local control, freedom from metastasis and cause specific survival in patients treated with prostate brachytherapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We followed 2,111 men who underwent brachytherapy a median of 6 years (range 2 to 17). Median prostate specific antigen was 7 ng/ml. Of the men 1,455 (68.9%) had clinical stage T2a or less and 1,428 (67.6%) had Gleason score less than 7. A total of 1,171 patients (55.5%) received (125)I, 221 (10.4%) received (103)Pd and 719 (34.1%) received supplemental external beam irradiation combined with (103)Pd. Post-implant dosimetry was done 30 days after implantation with doses converted to the biologically effective dose. Prostate biopsy was done 2 years after permanent prostate brachytherapy in 586 men (27.8%). Survival functions were determined by the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression with proportions tested by the log rank test. RESULTS: The 12-year biochemical freedom from failure rate was 78.6%, and stage, Gleason score, prostate specific antigen and biologically effective dose were significant predictors (p = 0.007, <0.001, 0.005 and <0.001, respectively). In 964 patients at low risk the biochemical freedom from failure rate was 88.1% and significant predictors were hormonal therapy (p = 0.030), prostate specific antigen (p = 0.026) and biologically effective dose (p = 0.003). In 499 patients at intermediate risk the biochemical freedom from failure rate was 79.2% with biologically effective dose a significant predictor (p <0.001). In 648 men at high risk the biochemical freedom from failure rate was 67% and significant predictors were hormonal therapy, Gleason score and biologically effective dose (p = 0.036, <0.001 and 0.012, respectively). The local failure rate was 7.3% with biologically effective dose a significant predictor (p <0.001). Prostate biopsy was positive in 21 of 121 cases (21.5%) for a biologically effective dose of 150 Gy2 or less, in 14 of 248 (5.6%) for greater than 150 to 200 Gy2 and in 3 of 193 (1.6%) for greater than 200 Gy2 (p <0.001). The 12-year freedom from metastasis rate was 95.2% with Gleason score a significant predictor (p <0.001). Cause specific survival at 12 years was 94.5% with Gleason score and biologically effective dose significant predictors (p <0.001 and 0.027, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Permanent prostate brachytherapy yields excellent long-term oncologic outcomes. High biologically effective dose may need to be delivered to achieve successful biochemical freedom from failure, local control and cause specific survival.	3a
4016710	Surgical treatment of distant metastatic melanoma. Indications and results.	A retrospective study was made of the surgical treatment of distant metastases from melanoma in 143 patients. The determinants of survival benefit were: (1) successful complete resection of all clinical disease; (2) single versus multiple metastatic site; and (3) anatomic location of disease. Complete resection was achieved with single- and multiple-site lesions in 67% and 31% of the patients, respectively, yielding corresponding 5-year survival rates of 33% and 9%, respectively. Incomplete resection yielded little survival benefit. Soft tissue and extraregional nodal lesions were completely resectable in 70%, whereas pulmonary, extrahepatic abdominal visceral, and osseous lesions were in 40% of the patients, resulting in similar 5-year survival rates of 17% to 22%. The operative mortality rate was 1.4% (2/143). Unsuccessful resection frequently led to very long hospitalization periods for complications and disease, with some patients spending more than 50% of their remaining survival time in the hospital. These observations suggest that, with proper selection of patients, guided by these determinants, surgical resection can offer a reasonable expectation of prolonged survival.	3b
26589131	Induction chemotherapy followed by concurrent radio-chemotherapy versus concurrent radio-chemotherapy alone as treatment of locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (HNSCC): A meta-analysis of randomized trials.	BACKGROUND: Induction chemotherapy with docetaxel, cisplatin and 5 FU (TPF) before radiotherapy (RT) or radio-chemotherapy (RT-CHX) has been shown to improve overall survival (OS) compared to induction chemotherapy with cisplatin and 5 FU in locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (HNSCC). Whether TPF induction before RT-CHX improves clinical outcome in comparison with RT-CHX alone is still a matter of debate. Recently, the results of 5 randomized trials addressing this question have become available. METHODS: In the 5 trials of interest, in total 1022 patients with locally advanced HNSCC were randomly assigned to receive either TPF induction CHX followed by concurrent RT-CHX or concurrent RT-CHX alone. Platin or taxane based CHX was used during RT. 51.3% of the patients had oropharyngeal, 7.3% hypoharyngeal, 18.7% laryngeal, 19.4% oral cavity and 3.5% had other HNSCC. Published hazard ratios and hazard ratios extracted from available survival curves for OS and progression free survival (PFS) were basis of the meta-analysis. Meta-analysis of the effect sizes on OS and PFS was performed using a random effects model based on parameter estimates of log hazard ratios in Cox models and their standard errors. RESULTS: Additional induction CHX with TPF before RT-CHX did neither result in a significant improvement of OS (Hazard Ratio: 1.010, 95% confidence limits (CL) 0.84-1.21, p=0.92), nor in a statistically significant benefit of PFS (Hazard Ratio: 0.91, 95% CL 0.75-1.1, p=0.32). CONCLUSION: Additional induction CHX with TPF before RT-CHX does not improve OS and PFS in locally advanced HNSCC compared to definite RT-CHX.	1a
24083757	Is FDG -PET-CT a valuable tool in prediction of persistent disease in head and neck cancer.	OBJECTIVES: To evaluate accuracy of FDG-PET CT in prediction of persistent disease in head and neck cancer cases and to determine prognostic value of metabolic tumor response. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 2009 and 2011, 46 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck receiving PET-CT were treated with definitive radiotherapy, with or without chemotherapy. There were 29 nasopharyngeal, 11 hypopharyngeal, 3 oropharyngeal and 3 laryngeal cancer patients, with a median age of 50.5 years (range 16-84), 32 males and 14 females. All patients were evaluated with PET-CT median 3-5 months (2.4-9.4) after completion of radiotherapy. RESULTS: After a median 20 months of follow up, complete metabolic response was observed in 63% of patients. Suspicious residual uptake was present in 10.9% and residual metabolic uptake in 26.0% of patients. The overall sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of FDG-PET-CT for detection of residual disease was 91% and 81%, 64% and 96% respectively. Two year LRC was 95% in complete responders while it was 34% in non-complete responders. CONCLUSIONS: FDG PET CT is a valuable tool for assessment of treatment response, especially in patients at high risk of local recurrence, and also as an indicator of prognosis. Definitely more precise criteria are required for assessment of response, there being no clear cut uptake value indicating residual disease. Futhermore, repair processes of normal tissue may consume glucose which appear as increased uptake in control FDG PET CT.	4
16280755	Comparison of endorectal magnetic resonance imaging, guided prostate biopsy and digital rectal examination in the preoperative anatomical localization of prostate cancer.	PURPOSE: We compared the accuracy of endorectal magnetic resonance imaging (erMRI), transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) guided biopsy and digital rectal examination (DRE) for detecting the location of cancer in the prostate gland and seminal vesicles. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a retrospective study of 106 consecutive patients with prostate cancer who were referred for erMRI before radical prostatectomy. Step-section pathological data and erMRI were available in 90 patients, DRE data were available on 86 and individually labeled sextant core biopsies were available in 45. T1 and T2-weighted erMRI was interpreted by a single reader, who scored the likelihood of tumor on a 5-point scale in each seminal vesicle and in 12 locations in the prostate gland. MR spectroscopy data were not used for erMRI interpretation. One pathologist reviewed whole mount serial sections of radical prostatectomy specimens. The area under ROC curves was used to evaluate accuracy. RESULTS: The area under ROC curves for tumor localization was higher for erMRI than for DRE at the prostatic apex (0.72 vs 0.66), mid gland (0.80 vs 0.69) and base (0.83 vs 0.69). It was likewise higher for erMRI than for TRUS biopsy in the mid gland (0.75 vs 0.68) and base (0.81 vs 0.61) but not in the apex (0.67 vs 0.70). On mixed model analysis erMRI significantly increased the accuracy of prostate cancer localization by DRE or TRUS biopsy (each p <0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: For prostate cancer localization erMRI contributes significant incremental value to DRE or TRUS biopsy findings (each p <0.0001).	2a
18657789	PET vs sentinel lymph node biopsy for staging melanoma: a patient intervention, comparison, outcome analysis.	BACKGROUND: Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is the gold standard to assess local lymph nodes in patients with melanoma. Positron emission tomography (PET) has been investigated as a noninvasive alternative to SLNB. METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted to evaluate PET and PET/computed tomography (CT) compared with SLNB for staging local lymph nodes in patients with intermediate-risk melanoma using the patient, intervention, comparison, outcome (PICO) search strategy. The PubMed, Medline, CancerLit, and Cochrane Library databases were searched for relevant published materials. Guidelines of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), and Cancer Care Ontario (CCO) were reviewed, as was the clinical resource, UpToDate. Studies were classified on the basis of levels of evidence delineated by the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine. RESULTS: The PICO search criteria identified 20 studies. There was no level 1 evidence. There were 7 level 2b articles. One review article was consecutive and thus classified as level 3a evidence. Three review articles were retrieved and categorized as level 3b. Three single-center studies were classified as level 3b, and another 3 were classified as level 4. There were two published letters, considered expert opinion and thus classified as level 5 evidence. All identified papers favored SLNB over PET or PET/CT for identifying occult locoregional lymph node metastases. CONCLUSION: Despite a lack of high-level evidence, the studies concluded that SLNB is superior to PET for local lymph node staging in patients with intermediate-risk melanoma. National guidelines confirmed these conclusions. The likelihood of PET/CT identifying distant metastases in this patient population is equally low because of the small risk for having distant metastases at diagnosis. Further study is required, including larger multicenter prospective trials.	3a
27013473	Randomized sham-controlled pilot trial of weekly electro-acupuncture for the prevention of taxane-induced peripheral neuropathy in women with early stage breast cancer.	To investigate the effect of electro-acupuncture (EA) as a non-pharmacological intervention to prevent or reduce chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) in breast cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy of taxane. Women with stage I-III breast cancer scheduled to receive taxane therapy were randomized to receive a standardized protocol of 12 true or sham EA (SEA) weekly treatments concurrent with taxane treatment. Subjects completed the Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form (BPI-SF), Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Taxane neurotoxicity subscale (FACT-NTX), and other assessments at baseline and weeks 6, 12, and 16. A total of 180 subjects were screened, 63 enrolled and 48 completed week 16 assessments. Mean age was 50 with 25 % white, 25 % black, and 43 % Hispanic; 52 % had no prior chemotherapy. At week 12, both groups reported an increase in mean BPI-SF worst pain score, but no mean differences were found between groups (SEA 2.8 vs. EA 2.6, P = .86). By week 16, the SEA group returned to baseline, while the EA group continued to worsen (SEA 1.7 vs. EA 3.4, P = .03). The increase in BPI-SF worst pain score was 1.62 points higher in the EA group than in the SEA group at week 16 (P = .04). In a randomized, sham-controlled trial of EA for prevention of taxane-induced CIPN, there were no differences in pain or neuropathy between groups at week 12. Of concern, subjects on EA had a slower recovery than SEA subjects. Future studies should focus on EA for treatment as opposed to prevention of CIPN.	2b
24863700	High-frequency ultrasonography but not 930-nm optical coherence tomography reliably evaluates melanoma thickness in vivo: a prospective validation study.	BACKGROUND: Early diagnosis and rapid surgical excision are essential for improving the prognosis of patients with melanoma. Reflectance confocal microscopy has been validated as a feasible procedure for in vivo diagnosis of melanoma but cannot be used to measure tumour thickness. However, ultrasonography and optical coherence tomography may allow melanoma thickness to be measured in vivo. OBJECTIVES: To validate the accuracy and reliability of high-frequency ultrasonography (HFUS) and optical coherence tomography for assessing melanoma thickness in vivo. METHODS: We conducted a prospective study on 131 patients with at least one equivocal melanocytic lesion. Each lesion underwent optical coherence tomography and HFUS assessment, followed by excision and pathological examination. Histopathology was considered to be the gold standard for assessing melanoma thickness. Repeatability, inter- and intrarater reproducibility and reliability were evaluated for each imaging procedure. RESULTS: Ultrasonography showed a good level of agreement with histology [intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) 0.807; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.703-0.877] and excellent inter-rater reproducibility (G = 0.97), resulting in reliable in vivo assessment of melanoma thickness. The 930-nm optical coherence tomography showed a poor level of agreement with histopathology (ICC 0.0; 95% CI -0.2-0.2) and the inter-rater reproducibility was null (G = 0.00). CONCLUSIONS: HFUS is a reliable and reproducible noninvasive method for assessing melanoma thickness. Routine use of HFUS may allow single-step excision of equivocal melanocytic lesions, with surgical margins determined by in vivo assessment of tumour thickness.	3a
20376442	Prognostic impact of para-aortic lymph node metastasis in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.	BACKGROUND: The aim of the present study was to clarify the prognostic impact of para-aortic lymph node metastasis in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. METHODS: Medical records of 103 consecutive patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, who underwent pancreatic resection with regional and para-aortic lymph node dissection were reviewed retrospectively. Clinicopathological factors and survival were compared between patients with and without para-aortic lymph node metastasis. RESULTS: Tumor size (p = 0.045), extrapancreatic nerve plexus invasion (p = 0.043), UICC pT factor (p = 0.026), and surgical margin status (p = 0.002) were associated significantly with para-aortic lymph node metastasis. Postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy (p < 0.001) and absence of extrapancreatic nerve plexus invasion (p = 0.041) were associated independently with longer survival, but para-aortic lymph node metastasis (p = 0.078) was not associated significantly with survival by multivariate analysis. The 2- and 5-year survival rates and median survival time of patients with and without para-aortic lymph node metastasis were 12, 0%, 12.4 months and 49, 23%, 14.5 months, respectively, and there was a significant difference in survival between the two groups by a log-rank test (p < 0.001). Postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy significantly improved the survival of patients with para-aortic lymph node metastasis (p = 0.025). CONCLUSIONS: The prognosis of patients with para-aortic lymph node metastasis is poor in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. However, postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy may improve survival.	2b
19040530	Oncological control after radical prostatectomy in men with clinical T3 prostate cancer: a single-centre experience.	OBJECTIVE: To determine the effectiveness of cancer control afforded by radical prostatectomy (RP) in patients with clinical stage T3 prostate cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed data for patients treated by RP for clinical stage T3 prostate cancer between 1995 and 2005. The following case characteristics were analysed: patient age, clinical presentation, preoperative prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, Gleason score, tumour stage (2002 Tumour-Node-Metastasis), surgical procedure, pathological data, margin and lymph node status, and recurrence. Biochemical recurrence was defined as an increase in PSA level of >0.2 ng/mL after surgery. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were generated, and prognostic factors were evaluated. RESULTS: Overall, 100 patients were included; only 79% of them had pT3 disease based on the pathological specimen. The median follow-up after RP was 69 months. The RP was open in 77 and laparoscopic in 23, with no significant difference between these approaches (P = 0.38). The 5-year PSA-free survival after surgery was 45%, and 5-year cancer-specific survival was 90%. On univariable analysis, Gleason score >7 (P = 0.01), pathological stage (pT2-T3a vs T3b) (P < 0.001), positive lymph node (P < 0.001), and positive margin (P < 0.001) were associated with recurrence. On multivariable analysis, lymph node, margin status and Gleason score were also significant (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: RP can be recommended as an alternative primary treatment that results in acceptable cancer control for clinical stage T3 prostate cancer in selected cases. However, the patient should be warned that surgery alone might not be sufficient to control the cancer, and that adjuvant therapy might be needed during the course of the disease.	3a
14665356	Comparing PSA outcome after radical prostatectomy or magnetic resonance imaging-guided partial prostatic irradiation in select patients with clinically localized adenocarcinoma of the prostate.	OBJECTIVES: To determine whether high-dose radiation delivered to a subvolume of the prostate gland (peripheral zone) using intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging-guided brachytherapy provided comparable 5-year prostate-specific antigen (PSA) control rates to radical prostatectomy (RP) in select patients compared prospectively but in a nonrandomized setting. METHODS: Between 1997 and 2002, 322 and 196 patients with clinical Stage T1c, PSA less than 10 ng/mL, biopsy Gleason score 3 + 4 or less, and without perineural invasion underwent RP or intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging-guided brachytherapy, respectively, and had a 2-year minimal follow-up. Cox regression multivariable analysis was used to evaluate whether the initial therapy, pretreatment PSA level, biopsy Gleason score, percentage of positive biopsies, or prostate gland volume were predictors of the time to post-therapy PSA failure. PSA failure was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and defined using the American Society for Therapeutic Radiology Oncology consensus definition. RESULTS: Only the percentage of positive prostate biopsies (P(Cox) = 0.02) was a significant predictor of the time to post-treatment PSA failure. However, the distribution of this parameter between RP and brachytherapy-treated patients was not significantly different (P(chi-square) = 0.25). The initial therapy did not predict for the time to post-therapy PSA failure (P(Cox) = 0.18). The 5-year estimate of PSA control was 93% versus 95% (P(log-rank) = 0.16) for the RP and brachytherapy patients, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Despite only partial prostatic irradiation using intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging-guided brachytherapy, similar 5-year estimates of PSA control were found for both brachytherapy and RP-managed patients.	2a
25650816	Comparison of Ivor-Lewis vs Sweet esophagectomy for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma: a randomized clinical trial.	IMPORTANCE: Sweet esophagectomy is performed widely in China, while the Ivor-Lewis procedure, with potential benefit of an extended lymphadenectomy, is limitedly conducted owing to concern for a higher risk for morbidity. Thus, the role of the Ivor-Lewis procedure for thoracic esophageal cancer needs further investigation. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether Ivor-Lewis esophagectomy is associated with increased postoperative complications compared with the Sweet procedure. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A randomized clinical trial was conducted from May 2010 to July 2012 at Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center, Shanghai, China, of 300 patients with resectable squamous cell carcinoma in the middle and lower third of the thoracic esophagus. Intent-to-treat analysis was performed. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomly assigned to receive either the Ivor-Lewis (n = 150) or Sweet (n = 150) esophagectomy. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome of this clinical trial was operative morbidity (any surgical or nonsurgical complications). Secondary outcomes included oncologic efficacy (number of lymph nodes resected and positive lymph nodes), postoperative mortality (30-day and in-hospital mortality), and patient discharge. RESULTS: Resection without macroscopical residual (R0/R1) was achieved in 149 of 150 patients in each group. Although there was no significant difference between the 2 groups regarding the incidence of each single complication, a significantly higher morbidity rate was found in the Sweet group (62 of 150 [41.3%]) than in the Ivor-Lewis group (45 of 150 [30%]) (P = .04). More patients in the Sweet group (8 of 150 [5.3%]) received reoperations than in the Ivor-Lewis group (1 of 150 [0.7%]) (P = .04). The median hospital stay was 18 days in the Sweet group vs 16 days in the Ivor-Lewis group (P = .002). Postoperative mortality rates in the Ivor-Lewis (1 of 150) and Sweet (3 of 150) groups were 0.7% and 2.0%, respectively (P = .25). More lymph nodes were removed during Ivor-Lewis esophagectomy than during the Sweet procedure (22 vs 18, P < .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Early results of this study demonstrate that the Ivor-Lewis procedure can be performed with lower rates of postoperative complications and more lymph node retrieval. Ivor-Lewis and Sweet esophagectomies are both safe procedures with low operative mortalities. TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier:NCT01047111.	1b
18325723	Outcome of R1 resection in patients undergoing pancreatico-duodenectomy for pancreatic cancer.	BACKGROUND: Pancreatico-duodenectomy (PD) is the only potentially curative treatment for pancreatic cancer, but most surgeons are reluctant to perform a palliative resection. The aim was to define the outcome for microscopically incomplete PD (R1). METHODS: Ninety-nine consecutive patients underwent laparotomy to perform PD. Sixty-seven patients were resected and 32 underwent palliative bypass (PSB) because of locally advanced disease. RESULTS: Of the 67 PD, 27 were classified as R0 and 40 as R1. Median survival for R0, R1 and PSB were 24, 18 and 9 months, respectively. Survival in the PSB group was 34% at 1 year and 0% at 2 years. 1-, 2- and 5-year survival in the R0 and R1 groups was 79% and 70%, 48.3% and 39.1%, 21.5% and 9.9%, respectively. Compared to PSB, both other groups were less likely to die over follow-up (p=0.002). Survival was not significantly different between the R0 and R1 groups (p=0.21). Perioperative morbidity and mortality were similar in the PD and PSB groups (29.9% and 3.0% vs 31.3 and 3.1%, respectively, p=1.00). CONCLUSIONS: Better survival in the resection group and similar perioperative risk would support the decision to perform PD even when there is the possibility of incomplete microscopic clearance.	2b
15351581	Effects of a diet rich in phytoestrogens on prostate-specific antigen and sex hormones in men diagnosed with prostate cancer.	OBJECTIVES: To determine the effects of diets rich in soy and linseed compared with a control diet on biochemical markers of prostate cancer in men diagnosed with prostate cancer. METHODS: Twenty-nine men diagnosed with prostate cancer and scheduled to undergo a radical prostatectomy were randomized to one of three groups: soy (high phytoestrogen), soy and linseed (high phytoestrogen), or wheat (low phytoestrogen). A bread was specially manufactured to incorporate 50 g of heat-treated (HT) soy grits or 50 g of HT soy grits and 20 g of linseed as part of the study participant's daily diet. Baseline and preoperative levels of prostate-specific antigen (PSA), free PSA, testosterone, sex hormone-binding globulin, free androgen index, and dihydrotestosterone were measured. RESULTS: Statistically significant differences were detected between the HT soy grits group and the control wheat group for the percentage of change in total PSA (-12.7% versus 40%, P = 0.02) and the percentage of change in free/total PSA ratio (27.4% versus -15.6%, P = 0.01); and between the HT soy grits group and the HT soy grits and linseed group for the percentage of change in free androgen index (16.4% versus -15.5%, P = 0.04) and the percentage of change in free/total PSA ratio (27.4% versus -10%, P = 0.007). CONCLUSIONS: The data from this study indicate that a daily diet containing four slices of a bread rich in HT soy grits favorably influences the PSA level and the free/total PSA ratio in patients with prostate cancer. This work provides some evidence to support epidemiologic studies claiming that male populations who consume high phytoestrogen diets have a reduced risk of prostate cancer development and progression.	2b
21745832	A comparative efficacy of amitriptyline, gabapentin, and pregabalin in neuropathic cancer pain: a prospective randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study.	Neuropathic pain is difficult to diagnose and difficult to treat with certainty. So the aim of the study was to evaluate comparative clinical efficacy of pregabaline with amitriptyline and gabapentin in neuropathic cancer pain. A total of 120 patients with cancer having severe neuropathic cancer pain were enrolled in the study after taking approval from Institutional Ethics Committee and divided in to 4 groups: group AT-amitriptyline, group GB-gabapentin, group PG-pregabalin, and group PL-placebo. Oral morphine was used for rescue analgesic for continued pain. Pain score (Visual Analogue scale) and secondary outcome measures such as intensity of lancinating, dysesthesia, and burning on numerical rating scale, Global satisfaction score (GSS), Eastern Co-operative Oncology Group scoring (ECOG), and adverse effects were assessed. At the end of study there was significant decrease in pain score in group PG as compared to the other groups; group AT (P = .003), group GB (P = .042), and group PL (P = .024). Percentage of patients with lancinating pain and dysesthesia were significantly less in group PG as compared to groups GB and PL. All the patients in group PL needed rescue morphine. After 4 visits, maximum improvement in ECOG scoring and GSS scoring was observed in group PG patients. Our results suggested that all antineuropathic drugs are effective in relieving cancer-related neuropathic pain. There was statistically and clinically significant morphine sparing effect of pregabaline in relieving neuropathic cancer pain and neuropathic symptoms as compared to other antineuropathic drugs.	1b
27189614	Randomized controlled pilot trial of mindfulness-based stress reduction compared to psychoeducational support for persistently fatigued breast and colorectal cancer survivors.	PURPOSE: Cancer-related fatigue (CRF) is a disruptive symptom for many survivors. Despite promising evidence for efficacy of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) in reducing CRF, no trials comparing it to an active comparator for fatigued survivors have been published. The purpose of this trial was to compare MBSR to psychoeducation for CRF and associated symptoms. METHODS: Breast (n = 60) and colorectal (n = 11) cancer survivors (stage 0-III) with clinically significant CRF after completing chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy an average of 28 months prior to enrollment were randomized to MBSR or psychoeducation/support groups (PES). MBSR focused on mindfulness training; PES focused on CRF self-management. Outcomes included CRF interference (primary), CRF severity and global improvement, vitality, depression, anxiety, sleep disturbance, and pain. Outcomes were assessed at baseline (T1), post-intervention (T2), and 6-month follow-up (T3) using intent-to-treat analysis. RESULTS: Between-group differences in CRF interference were not significant at any time point; however, there was a trend favoring MBSR (d = -0.46, p = 0.073) at T2. MBSR participants reported significantly greater improvement in vitality (d = 0.53, p = 0.003) and were more likely to report CRF as moderately to completely improved compared to the PES group (chi2 (1) = 4.1765, p = 0.041) at T2. MBSR participants also reported significantly greater reductions in pain at T2 (d = 0.53, p = 0.014). In addition, both MBSR and PES produced moderate-to-large and significant within-group improvements in all fatigue outcomes, depression, anxiety, and sleep at T2 and T3 compared to T1. CONCLUSION: MBSR and PES appear efficacious for CRF and related symptoms. Larger trials including a usual care arm are warranted. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01724333.	1b
28384564	Effect of acupuncture on aromatase inhibitor-induced arthralgia in patients with breast cancer: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.	PURPOSE: Aromatase inhibitor (AI)-induced arthralgia (AIA) is a common side effect that may lead to premature discontinuation of effective hormonal therapy in patients with breast cancer. Acupuncture may relieve joint pain in patients with AIA. We conducted a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to evaluate the effectiveness of acupuncture in pain relief in AIA. METHODS: The PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Scopus databases and the ClinicalTrials.gov registry were searched for studies published before February 2017. Individual effect sizes were standardized, and a meta-analysis was conducted to calculate the pooled effect size by using a random effect model. Pain was assessed using the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) and Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) at 3-4, 6-8, and 12 weeks. Secondary outcomes included disability level, upper extremity function, physical performance, and quality of life. RESULTS: Five trials involving 181 patients were reviewed. Significant pain reduction was observed after 6-8 weeks of acupuncture treatment. Patients receiving acupuncture showed a significant decrease in the BPI worst pain score (weighted mean difference [WMD]: -3.81, 95% confidence interval [CI]: -5.15 to -2.47) and the WOMAC pain score (WMD: -130.77, 95% CI: -230.31 to -31.22) after 6-8 weeks of treatment. One of the 4 trials reported 18 minor adverse events in 8 patients during 398 intervention episodes. CONCLUSION: Acupuncture is a safe and viable nonpharmacologic treatment that may relieve joint pain in patients with AIA. Additional studies involving a higher number of RCTs are warranted.	1a
8401455	The impact of generalized malignant melanoma on quality of life evaluated by the EORTC questionnaire technique.	Eighty-nine patients with generalized malignant melanoma, 63% men and median age 53 years, were included in a longitudinal quality of life (QOL) study before the start of chemotherapy. QOL was assessed by the EORTC core questionnaire technique (QLQ-C36), a study-specific melanoma (MM) module and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression (HAD) scale. The questionnaires displayed good psychometric qualities and were able to document the florid symptomatology of disseminated melanoma. They were well accepted by the patients. Before treatment the patients reported a relatively low symptom burden, good physical and social functioning, moderate psychological distress and a high overall QOL rating during the past week. Fatigue and pain were the most frequent symptoms reported. The QOL measurement differentiated between subgroups of patients differing in performance status and the tumour burden. We conclude that the EORTC questionnaire technique is feasible and clinically relevant in generalized malignant melanoma patients.	4
17579613	Randomized trial comparing cryoablation and external beam radiotherapy for T2C-T3B prostate cancer.	The objective was to evaluate the relative efficacy of cryoablation (CRYO) versus external beam radiation (EBRT) for clinically locally advanced prostate cancer in a randomized clinical trial. Patients with histologically proven, clinically staged as T2C, T3A or T3B disease were randomized with 6 months of perioperative hormone therapy to one of the two procedures. Owing largely to a shift in practice to longer term adjuvant hormonal therapy and higher doses of radiation for T3 disease, only 64 out of the planned 150 patients were accrued. Twenty-one of 33 (64%) in the CRYO group and 14 of 31 (45%) in the EBRT-treated group who had met the ASTRO definition of failure were also classified as treatment failure. The mean biochemical disease-free survival (bDFS) was 41 months for the EBRT group compared to 28 months for the CRYO group. The 4-year bDFS for EBRT and CRYO groups were 47 and 13%, respectively. Disease-specific survival (DSS) and overall survival (OS) for both groups were very similar. Serious complications were uncommon in either group. EBRT patients exhibited gastrointestinal (GI) adverse effects more frequently. Taking into account the relative deficiency in numbers and the original trial design, this prospective randomized trial indicated that the results of CRYO were less favorable compared to those of EBRT, and was suboptimal primary therapy in locally advanced prostate cancer.	1a
21383291	Single-dose fosaprepitant for the prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting associated with cisplatin therapy: randomized, double-blind study protocol--EASE.	PURPOSE: Addition of aprepitant, a neurokinin-1 receptor antagonist (NK1RA), to an ondansetron and dexamethasone regimen improves prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea/vomiting (CINV), particularly during the delayed phase (DP; 25 to 120 hours). Therefore, recommended antiemetic regimens include multiple-day NK1RA administration. Preliminary data suggested that single-dose aprepitant before chemotherapy could provide CINV protection throughout the overall risk phase (OP; 0 to 120 hours). This study compared a 3-day oral aprepitant schedule to a regimen containing a single dose of the intravenous NK1RA fosaprepitant. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A randomized, double-blind, active-control design was used to test whether fosaprepitant is noninferior to aprepitant. Patients receiving cisplatin >/= 70 mg/m(2) for the first time received ondansetron and dexamethasone with a standard aprepitant regimen (125 mg on day 1, 80 mg on day 2, 80 mg on day 3) or a single-dose fosaprepitant regimen (150 mg on day 1). The primary end point was complete response (CR; no vomiting, no rescue medication) during OP. Secondary end points were CR during DP and no vomiting during OP. Accrual of 1,113 evaluable patients per treatment arm was planned to confirm noninferiority with expected CR of 67.7% and noninferiority margin of minus 7 percentage points. RESULTS: A total of 2,322 patients were randomly assigned, and 2,247 were evaluable for efficacy. Antiemetic protection with aprepitant and fosaprepitant was equivalent within predefined bounds for noninferiority. Both regimens were well tolerated, although more frequent infusion site pain/erythema/thrombophlebitis was seen with fosaprepitant relative to aprepitant (2.7% v 0.3%, respectively). CONCLUSION: Given with ondansetron and dexamethasone, single-dose intravenous fosaprepitant (150 mg) was noninferior to standard 3-day oral aprepitant in preventing CINV during OP and DP.	1a
29374757	Solarium Use and Risk for Malignant Melanoma: Meta-analysis and Evidence-based Medicine Systematic Review.	BACKGROUND: There is an ongoing debate whether solarium use (indoor tanning/artificial UV) may increase the risk for primary cutaneous malignant melanoma. AIM: A systematic literature search was conducted using MEDLINE and ISI Web of Science. Included studies were critically assessed regarding their risk of bias, and methodological shortcomings. Levels of evidence and grades of recommendation were determined according to guidelines of the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine. Summary risk estimates and 95% confidence intervals for four different outcomes (ever exposure, exposure at younger age, high/low exposure vs. non-exposure) were derived from random-effects meta-analyses to account for possible heterogeneity across studies. RESULTS: Two cohort and twenty-nine case-control studies were eligible. Overall, quality of included studies was poor as a result of severe limitations, including possible recall and selection bias, and due to lack of interventional trials. Summary risk estimates suggested a weak association (odds ratio (OR)=1.19, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.04-1.35, p=0.009) for ever-exposure to UV radiation from a solarium with melanoma risk. However, sensitivity analyses did not show an association for studies from Europe (OR=1.10; 95%CI=0.95-1.27, p=0.218), studies with low risk of bias (OR=1.15; 95%CI=0.94-1.41, p=0.179), and studies conducted after 1990 (OR 1.09; 95%CI=0.93-1.29, p=0.295). Moreover, moderate associations were found for first exposure to UV radiation from a solarium at younger age (<25 years) and high exposure (>10 sessions in lifetime) with melanoma risk. However, for all outcomes analyzed, overall study quality and resulting levels of evidence (3a-) and grades of recommendation (D) were low due to lack of interventional studies and severe limitations including unobserved or unrecorded confounding. CONCLUSION: Current scientific knowledge is mainly based on observational studies with poor quality data, which report associations but do not prove causality. At present, there is no convincing evidence that moderate/responsible solarium use increases melanoma risk.	2a
23182993	Long-term results of RTOG 91-11: a comparison of three nonsurgical treatment strategies to preserve the larynx in patients with locally advanced larynx cancer.	PURPOSE: To report the long-term results of the Intergroup Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 91-11 study evaluating the contribution of chemotherapy added to radiation therapy (RT) for larynx preservation. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with stage III or IV glottic or supraglottic squamous cell cancer were randomly assigned to induction cisplatin/fluorouracil (PF) followed by RT (control arm), concomitant cisplatin/RT, or RT alone. The composite end point of laryngectomy-free survival (LFS) was the primary end point. RESULTS: Five hundred twenty patients were analyzed. Median follow-up for surviving patients is 10.8 years. Both chemotherapy regimens significantly improved LFS compared with RT alone (induction chemotherapy v RT alone: hazard ratio [HR], 0.75; 95% CI, 0.59 to 0.95; P = .02; concomitant chemotherapy v RT alone: HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.78 to 0.98; P = .03). Overall survival did not differ significantly, although there was a possibility of worse outcome with concomitant relative to induction chemotherapy (HR, 1.25; 95% CI, 0.98 to 1.61; P = .08). Concomitant cisplatin/RT significantly improved the larynx preservation rate over induction PF followed by RT (HR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.37 to 0.89; P = .0050) and over RT alone (P < .001), whereas induction PF followed by RT was not better than treatment with RT alone (HR, 1.26; 95% CI, 0.88 to 1.82; P = .35). No difference in late effects was detected, but deaths not attributed to larynx cancer or treatment were higher with concomitant chemotherapy (30.8% v 20.8% with induction chemotherapy and 16.9% with RT alone). CONCLUSION: These 10-year results show that induction PF followed by RT and concomitant cisplatin/RT show similar efficacy for the composite end point of LFS. Locoregional control and larynx preservation were significantly improved with concomitant cisplatin/RT compared with the induction arm or RT alone. New strategies that improve organ preservation and function with less morbidity are needed.	1b
26458070	Pragmatic staging of oesophageal cancer using decision theory involving selective endoscopic ultrasonography, PET and laparoscopy.	BACKGROUND: Following CT, guidelines for staging oesophageal and gastro-oesophageal junction (GOJ) cancer recommend endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS), PET-CT and laparoscopy for T3-T4 GOJ tumours. These recommendations are based on generic utilities, but it is unclear whether the test risk outweighs the potential benefit for some patients. This study sought to quantify investigation risks, benefits and utilities, in order to develop pragmatic, personalized staging recommendations. METHODS: All patients with a histological diagnosis of oesophageal or GOJ cancer staged between May 2006 and July 2013 comprised a development set; those staged from July 2013 to July 2014 formed the prospective validation set. Probability thresholds of altering management were calculated and predictive factors identified. Algorithms and models (decision tree analysis, logistic regression, artificial neural networks) were validated internally and independently. RESULTS: Some 953 patients were staged following CT, by [(18) F]fluorodeoxyglucose PET-CT (918), EUS (798) and laparoscopy (458). Of these patients, 829 comprised the development set (800 PET-CT, 698 EUS, 397 laparoscopy) and 124 the validation set (118 PET-CT, 100 EUS, 61 laparoscopy). EUS utility in the 71.8 per cent of patients with T2-T4a disease on CT was minimal (0.4 per cent), its risk exceeding benefit. EUS was moderately accurate for pT1 N0 disease. A number of factors predicted metastases on PET-CT and laparoscopy, although none could inform an algorithm. PET-CT altered management in 23.0 per cent, and laparoscopy in 7.1 per cent, including those with T2 and distal oesophageal tumours. CONCLUSION: Although EUS provided additional information on T and N category, its risk outweighed potential benefit in patients with T2-T4a disease on CT. Laparoscopy seemed justified for distal oesophageal tumours of T2 or greater.	1b
21786113	Topical use of a silymarin-based preparation to prevent radiodermatitis : results of a prospective study in breast cancer patients.	PURPOSE: More than 80% of patients with breast cancer undergoing postsurgical radiotherapy (RT) will develop radiodermatitis and approximately 10% of these patients show grade 3 lesions. Side effects may reduce the patient's compliance and can be limiting factors to follow RT protocols. Therefore, there is a high need for more effective prophylactic treatments. In this study, a silymarin-based cream (Leviaderm((R))) was tested in comparison to our standard of care (SOC) at the involved site. METHODS: A total of 101 patients were evaluated after breast-conserving surgery followed by RT with 50.4 Gy plus boost 9-16 Gy. Of these, 51 patients were treated with the silymarin-based cream. In addition, 50 patients were documented receiving a panthenol-containing cream interventionally, if local skin lesions occurred. The acute skin reactions were classified according to the RTOG and VAS (Visual Analogue Scale) scores. RESULTS: The median time to toxicity was prolonged significantly with silymarin-based cream (45 vs. 29 days (SOC), p < 0.0001). Only 9.8% of patients using silymarin-based cream showed grade 2 toxicity in week 5 of RT in comparison to 52% with SOC. At the end of RT, 23.5% of patients in the silymarin-based study group developed no skin reactions vs. 2% with SOC, while grade 3 toxicity occurred only in 2% in the silymarin-based arm compared to 28% (SOC). CONCLUSIONS: Silymarin-based cream Leviaderm((R)) may be a promising and effective treatment for the prevention of acute skin lesions caused by RT of breast cancer patients. To confirm the results of this nonrandomized, observational trial, this component should be tested in larger multicenter studies in this setting.	2b
20824720	Molecular predictors of outcome in a phase 3 study of gemcitabine and erlotinib therapy in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer: National Cancer Institute of Canada Clinical Trials Group Study PA.3.	BACKGROUND: National Cancer Institute of Canada Clinical Trials Group PA.3 (NCIC CTG PA.3) was a phase 3 study (n = 569) that demonstrated benefits for overall survival and progression-free survival with the addition of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) erlotinib to gemcitabine in patients with advanced pancreatic carcinoma (APC). Mutation status of the v-Ki-ras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) and EGFR gene copy number (GCN) were evaluated as predictive markers in 26% of patients who had tumor samples available for analysis. METHODS: KRAS mutation status was evaluated by direct sequencing of exon 2, and EGFR GCN was determined by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis. The results were correlated with survival, which was the primary endpoint of the trial. RESULTS: KRAS analysis was successful in 117 patients, and EGFR FISH analysis was successful in 107 patients. KRAS mutations were identified in 92 patients (78.6%), and EGFR amplification or high polysomy (FISH-positive results) was identified in 50 patients (46.7%). The hazard ratio of death between gemcitabine/erlotinib and gemcitabine/placebo was 0.66 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.28-1.57) for patients with wild-type KRAS and 1.07 (95% CI, 0.68-1.66) for patients with mutant KRAS (P value for interaction = .38), and the hazard ratio was 0.6 (95% CI, 0.34-1.07) for FISH-negative patients and 0.90 (95% CI, 0.49-1.65) for FISH-positive patients (P value for interaction = .32). CONCLUSIONS: In a molecular subset analysis of patients from NCIC CTG PA.3, EGFR GCN and KRAS mutation status were not identified as markers predictive of a survival benefit from the combination of erlotinib with gemcitabine for the first-line treatment of APC.	2b
29998338	Effect of Acupuncture vs Sham Acupuncture or Waitlist Control on Joint Pain Related to Aromatase Inhibitors Among Women With Early-Stage Breast Cancer: A Randomized Clinical Trial.	Importance: Musculoskeletal symptoms are the most common adverse effects of aromatase inhibitors and often result in therapy discontinuation. Small studies suggest that acupuncture may decrease aromatase inhibitor-related joint symptoms. Objective: To determine the effect of acupuncture in reducing aromatase inhibitor-related joint pain. Design, Setting, and Patients: Randomized clinical trial conducted at 11 academic centers and clinical sites in the United States from March 2012 to February 2017 (final date of follow-up, September 5, 2017). Eligible patients were postmenopausal women with early-stage breast cancer who were taking an aromatase inhibitor and scored at least 3 on the Brief Pain Inventory Worst Pain (BPI-WP) item (score range, 0-10; higher scores indicate greater pain). Interventions: Patients were randomized 2:1:1 to the true acupuncture (n = 110), sham acupuncture (n = 59), or waitlist control (n = 57) group. True acupuncture and sham acupuncture protocols consisted of 12 acupuncture sessions over 6 weeks (2 sessions per week), followed by 1 session per week for 6 weeks. The waitlist control group did not receive any intervention. All participants were offered 10 acupuncture sessions to be used between weeks 24 and 52. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary end point was the 6-week BPI-WP score. Mean 6-week BPI-WP scores were compared by study group using linear regression, adjusted for baseline pain and stratification factors (clinically meaningful difference specified as 2 points). Results: Among 226 randomized patients (mean [SD] age, 60.7 [8.6] years; 88% white; mean [SD] baseline BPI-WP score, 6.6 [1.5]), 206 (91.1%) completed the trial. From baseline to 6 weeks, the mean observed BPI-WP score decreased by 2.05 points (reduced pain) in the true acupuncture group, by 1.07 points in the sham acupuncture group, and by 0.99 points in the waitlist control group. The adjusted difference for true acupuncture vs sham acupuncture was 0.92 points (95% CI, 0.20-1.65; P = .01) and for true acupuncture vs waitlist control was 0.96 points (95% CI, 0.24-1.67; P = .01). Patients in the true acupuncture group experienced more grade 1 bruising compared with patients in the sham acupuncture group (47% vs 25%; P = .01). Conclusions and Relevance: Among postmenopausal women with early-stage breast cancer and aromatase inhibitor-related arthralgias, true acupuncture compared with sham acupuncture or with waitlist control resulted in a statistically significant reduction in joint pain at 6 weeks, although the observed improvement was of uncertain clinical importance. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01535066.	2b
20049658	Sun protection intervention for highway workers: long-term efficacy of UV photography and skin cancer information on men's protective cognitions and behavior.	BACKGROUND: The risk for skin cancer is increased among older males and outdoor workers who have high levels of ultraviolet (UV) exposure. PURPOSE: This study was designed to examine the long-term efficacy of UV photography interventions on male outdoor workers, the potential mediators of its impact, and the efficacy of UV photography and skin cancer vs. aging information with this population. METHODS: One hundred forty-eight male outdoor workers were randomly assigned to one of four intervention conditions or a control condition in a two by two plus one factorial design. The men in the intervention conditions received or did not receive a UV photo of their face and watched either a photoaging or skin cancer educational video. Participants completed pre-intervention, immediate post-intervention, and 2-month and 1-year follow-up assessments. RESULTS: Analysis of covariance and structural equation modeling revealed that participants in the UV photography and cancer information interventions reported higher levels of sun protection cognitions, which were significant partial mediators of increases in sun protection behaviors and decreases in skin color. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence for effective sun protection interventions on male outdoor workers that may help reduce skin cancer risk.	1a
20647337	Oral selenium supplementation has no effect on prostate-specific antigen velocity in men undergoing active surveillance for localized prostate cancer.	The Nutritional Prevention of Cancer trial showed a 52% lower incidence of prostate cancer in men supplemented with selenium. As a result, our study was designed to assess whether selenium supplementation attenuates the progression of prostate cancer. A phase 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted in men with localized nonmetastatic prostate cancer who had elected to forgo active treatment and be followed by active surveillance. A total of 140 men were randomized to placebo (n = 46), 200 microg/d (n = 47), or 800 microg/d (n = 47) selenium p.o. (as selenized yeast) and followed every 3 months for up to 5 years. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) velocity was used as a marker of prostate cancer progression and was estimated using mixed-effects regression. Adjusting for age, body mass index, baseline selenium, smoking, baseline PSA, race, PSA method, and Gleason score, PSA velocities for the 200 microg/d and 800 microg/d treatment groups were not statistically significantly different from placebo (P = 0.32 and P = 0.61, respectively). In the highest quartile of baseline selenium, men supplemented with 800 microg selenium showed statistically significantly higher PSA velocity as compared with placebo (P = 0.018). Selenium supplementation did not show a protective effect on PSA velocity in subjects with localized prostate cancer. On the contrary, supplementation with high-dose selenium was observed to be a risk factor for increased PSA velocity in men with high baseline plasma selenium concentrations.	2b
18243498	Cardiovascular mortality and duration of androgen deprivation for locally advanced prostate cancer: analysis of RTOG 92-02.	OBJECTIVES: Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists (GnRHa) are associated with greater risk of coronary heart disease and myocardial infarction in men with prostate cancer, but little is known about their potential effects on cardiovascular mortality. We assessed the relationship between duration of GnRHa therapy and cardiovascular mortality in a large randomized trial of men treated with short-term versus longer-term adjuvant goserelin and radiation therapy (RT) for locally advanced prostate cancer. METHODS: From 1992 to 1995, 1554 men with locally advanced prostate cancer (T2c-4, prostate-specific antigen [PSA] <150 ng/ml) received RT and 4 mo of goserelin and then were randomized to no additional therapy (arm 1) or 24 mo adjuvant goserelin (arm 2) in a phase 3 trial (Radiation Therapy Oncology Group [RTOG] 92-02). Cox regression analyses were performed to evaluate the relationship between treatment arm and cardiovascular mortality. Covariates included age, prevalent cardiovascular disease (CVD), hypertension, diabetes (DM), race, PSA, Gleason score, and stage. RESULTS: After median follow-up of 8.1 yr, 185 cardiovascular-related deaths had occurred. No increase in cardiovascular mortality occurred for men receiving a longer duration of goserelin. At 5 yr, cardiovascular mortality for men receiving longer-term adjuvant goserelin was 5.9% versus 4.8% with short-term goserelin (Gray's p=0.16). In multivariate analyses, treatment arm was not significantly associated with increased risk of cardiovascular mortality (adjusted hazard ratio [HR]=1.09; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.81-1.47; p=0.58; when censoring at time of salvage goserelin, HR=1.02, 95%CI, 0.73-1.43; p=0.9). Traditional cardiac risk factors, including age, prevalent CVD, and DM, were significantly associated with greater cardiovascular mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Longer duration of adjuvant GnRHa therapy does not appear to increase cardiovascular mortality in men with locally advanced prostate cancer.	1a
16443733	Tumour lymphangiogenesis is a possible predictor of sentinel lymph node status in cutaneous melanoma: a case-control study.	BACKGROUND: Cutaneous melanoma spreads preferentially through the lymphatic route and sentinel lymph node (SLN) status is regarded as the most important predictor of survival. AIMS: To evaluate whether tumour lymphangiogenesis and the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor C (VEGF-C) is related to the risk of SLN metastasis and to clinical outcome in a case-control series of patients with melanoma. METHODS: Forty five invasive melanoma specimens (15 cases and 30 matched controls) were investigated by immunostaining for the lymphatic endothelial marker D2-40 and for VEGF-C. Lymphangiogenesis was measured using computer assisted morphometric analysis. RESULTS: Peritumorous lymphatic vessels were more numerous, had larger average size, and greater relative area than intratumorous lymphatics. The number and area of peritumorous and intratumorous lymphatics was significantly higher in melanomas associated with SLN metastasis than in non-metastatic melanomas. No significant difference in VEGF-C expression by neoplastic cells was shown between metastatic and non-metastatic melanomas. Using logistic regression analysis, intratumorous lymphatic vessel (LV) area was the most significant predictor of SLN metastasis (p = 0.04). Using multivariate analysis, peritumorous LV density was an independent variable affecting overall survival, whereas the intratumorous LV area approached significance (p = 0.07). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence that the presence of high peritumorous and intratumorous lymphatic microvessel density is associated with SLN metastasis and shorter survival. The intratumorous lymphatic vessel area is the most significant factor predicting SLN metastasis. The tumour associated lymphatic network constitutes a potential criterion in the selection of high risk patients for complementary treatment and a new target for antimelanoma therapeutic strategies.	3b
26464077	Early Palliative Care in Advanced Oncologic and Non-Oncologic Chronic Diseases: A Systematic Review of Literature.	BACKGROUND: To assess the role of early palliative care in patients with advanced oncologic and non-oncologic chronic diseases. METHODS: A qualitative systematic review of literature was performed. All the randomized phase III trials comparing early, simultaneous palliative care and standard care in patients with advanced oncologic and non-oncologic diseases were considered eligible and included into the analysis. The outcomes were classified into 6 classes: quality of life, symptoms control, overall survival, quality of care, patients' and caregivers' satisfaction, and costs of the assistance. RESULTS: Twelve papers reporting the data of 9 trials were considered eligible and included into the analysis. Two nonrandomized trials were also included into the selection because of the methods used by the authors. The early, simultaneous approach was reported to improve quality of life in two out of 7 papers, symptoms control in 1 out of 5 papers, overall survival in 2 out of 3 papers, quality of care in 5 out of 8 papers, patients' or caregivers' satisfaction in 3 out of 4 papers; and to reduce the costs of assistance in 2 out of 3 papers. CONCLUSION: Early palliative care improves the main outcomes of the assistance in patients with advanced oncologic and non-oncologic chronic diseases. The available data are probably enough to consider early palliative cares a novel standard of care in these groups of patients.	1a
30026821	Zusanli (ST36) Acupoint Injection with Neostigmine for Paralytic Postoperative Ileus following Radical Gastrectomy for Gastric Cancer: a Randomized Clinical Trial.	Background: The Zusanli (ST36) acupoint has been associated with treatment of various gastrointestinal conditions. There have been no studies of acupuncture therapy for paralytic postoperative ileus (PPOI). Materials and methods: Patients with PPOI following gastrectomy for gastric cancer were randomized to receive ST36 acupoint injection with neostigmine, gluteal intramuscular injection with 1.0 mg neostigmine, ST36 acupuncture alone, or standard therapy. The main outcome was the effectiveness rate for recovery of peristalsis. Secondary outcomes were time to bowel sound recovery, time to first flatus, and time to first defecation. Tertiary outcomes were drug-related adverse events, including abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, tearing, delirium, seizure, and anxiety. Results: ST36 acupoint injection with neostigmine and gluteal intramuscular injection of neostigmine gave a higher rate of peristalsis recovery, and the ST36 acupoint injection group showed significantly higher total effectiveness rate than that of the intramuscular injection group. These interventions gave significantly shorter times to bowel sound recovery, shorter times to first flatus and first defecation compared with ST36 acupuncture and standard post-operative therapy (P < 0.01). ST36 acupoint injection group gave shorter time to bowel sound recovery, shorter time to first flatus and first defecation than those of the intramuscular injection group (P < 0.01). Drug-related adverse events in the intramuscular injection group were more serious than in the ST36 acupoint injection group (P < 0.05). Conclusion: ST36 acupoint injection with neostigmine is safe and effective for treatment of PPOI.	2b
11753959	Alternating chemoradiotherapy versus partly accelerated radiotherapy in locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck: results from a phase III randomized trial.	BACKGROUND: The authors previously have found that in patients with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCC-HN), alternating chemoradiotherapy (ALT) was superior to low-total-dose conventional radiotherapy alone. The purpose of this randomized trial was to compare the same chemoradiotherapy approach with high-total-dose partly accelerated radiotherapy. METHODS: During 6 years, 136 consecutive patients with previously untreated unfavorable Stage II or Stage III-IV (International Union Against Cancer) SCC of the oral cavity, pharynx, and larynx were enrolled. They were randomly assigned to chemotherapy consisting of 4 cycles of intravenous cisplatin (20 mg/m(2) of body surface area per day for 5 consecutive days) and 5-fluorouracil (200 mg/m(2) per day for 5 consecutive days; weeks 1, 4, 7, and 10) alternated with three 2-week courses of radiotherapy (20 grays [Gy] per course, 2 Gy per day, 5 days per week; ALT, 70 patients) or to partly accelerated radiotherapy with final concomitant boost technique (75 Gy/40 fractions in 6 weeks; partly accelerated radiotherapy [PA-RT], 66 patients). RESULTS: At the median follow-up of 60 months (range, 30-102 months), no statistical differences were observed in overall survival, progression free survival, or locoregional control between the 2 treatments. Actuarial 3-year overall survival and progression free survival were 37% and 35%, respectively, in the ALT group and 29% and 27%, respectively, in PA-RT group. The median overall survival and progression free survival were 24 and 15 months, respectively, in the ALT arm and 18 and 11 months, respectively, in PA-RT arm. Actuarial 3-year locoregional control rates were 32% in the ALT group and 27% in the PA-RT group. At multivariate analysis, tumor classification was the only factor that emerged as a significant independent variable affecting overall survival. Patients treated in the PA-RT arm experienced higher Grade 3+ (World Health Organization) acute skin and mucosal reactions than patients in the ALT arm. Moreover, local late mucosal and skin toxicities occurred more often in patients treated with PA-RT. CONCLUSIONS: This trial failed to disclose statistically significant differences in the outcome of patients treated with either ALT or PA-RT. Therefore, definitive conclusions could not be made. However, acute skin effects and late mucosal and skin toxicities above the clavicles appeared to be significantly lower with chemoradiotherapy.	2b
3599990	Metastatic disease in patients with newly diagnosed malignant melanoma.	In patients with stage I Clark's level III and IV malignant melanoma (MM), recurrence rates of 30-60% can be expected after resection of the primary lesion. If metastatic disease could be detected early and treated in such patients, survival might be prolonged. Ninety patients (37 males and 53 females) with newly diagnosed, resected stage I cutaneous MM, levels III and IV, were evaluated for metastatic disease at diagnosis using a physical examination; CBC; SMA 18; chest films; brain computed tomography (CT) scan; and radioisotope liver, spleen, and bone scans. Forty-four patients had level III and 46 had level IV melanomas ranging in thickness from 0.65 to 4.5 mm. None of these 90 patients was found to have metastatic disease. Such tests are not useful and can be replaced by a history and physical examination with substantially improved cost effectiveness.	4
18683009	Pancreaticoduodenectomy with vascular resection for local advanced pancreatic head cancer: a single center retrospective study.	INTRODUCTION: Pancreaticoduodenectomy with vascular resection remains a controversial approach for patients with local advanced pancreatic head cancer for the lack of evidences of survival and quality of life benefits. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether patients of pancreatic head cancer benefit on quality of life, survival, and treatment cost from pancreaticoduodenectomy with vascular resection compared with palliative therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two hundred fourteen patients of pancreatic head cancer whose pancreatic head could not be dissected free from adjacent vascular were involved in this study. Eighty of these patients underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy with vascular resection, whereas other patients underwent palliative therapy. RESULTS: Pancreaticoduodenectomy with artery resection offered worse outcomes on almost all aspects of quality of life and survival compared with palliative therapy. Pancreaticoduodenectomy with vein resection offered better 5-year survival compared with palliative therapy, whereas palliative therapy offered better quality of life after surgery. CONCLUSION: Pancreaticoduodenectomy with artery resection is nonsensical on treatment of pancreatic head cancer with artery adhesion/invasion. As for patients with vein adhesion/invasion, pancreaticoduodenectomy with vein resection should be performed cautiously. When actual vein invasion is very possible to have taken place, the choice of treatment strategy should be considered carefully by the pancreatic surgeons.	4
25922233	Combination antiemetic therapy with aprepitant/fosaprepitant in patients with colorectal cancer receiving oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy (SENRI trial): a multicentre, randomised, controlled phase 3 trial.	INTRODUCTION: The oral neurokinin-1 antagonist aprepitant is recommended in several guidelines for preventing chemotherapy-induced nausea & vomiting (CINV) due to highly emetogenic cancer chemotherapy. Little is known about the feasibility and safety of aprepitant in patients treated with oxaliplatin. METHODS: In this multicentre, open label, randomised, phase 3 trial, we recruited patients with colorectal cancer who underwent an oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy. Patients were centrally randomised in a 1:1 ratio to the control group (5-HT3-receptor antagonist+dexamethasone) or aprepitant group (5-HT3-receptor antagonist+dexamethasone+aprepitant or fosaprepitant) in the first course. All patients were treated with aprepitant/fosaprepitant therapy in the second course. The primary end-point was the proportion of patients with no emesis. RESULTS: A total of 413 patients entered this clinical trial from 25 centres in Japan. Significantly more patients in the aprepitant group achieved no vomiting overall and delayed phase than those in the control group (95.7% versus 83.6%, and 95.7% versus 84.7%, respectively). The aprepitant group also had statistically significantly higher percentages of no significant nausea, complete response and complete protection than the control group overall. In the control group, the percentages of no vomiting were higher in the second cycle than in the first cycle. The incidence of vomiting occurred day 7 or later was significantly higher in the control group compared with the aprepitant group. Other adverse events were not significant between the groups. CONCLUSION: The aprepitant therapy was more effective than the control therapy for prevention of CINV in colorectal cancer patients receiving an oxaliplatin-based regimen.	1b
12169914	Management of T3N0M0 glottic carcinoma: therapeutic outcomes.	BACKGROUND: The best therapeutic approach for the treatment of T3N0M0 (stage III) glottic carcinoma is controversial. METHOD: A retrospective study of Tumor Research Project data were performed using patients with T3N0M0 glottic squamous cell carcinoma treated with curative intent by seven different treatment modalities from January 1950 to December 1996 at Washington University School of Medicine/Barnes-Jewish Hospital. RESULTS: Two hundred patients with T3N0M0 glottic carcinoma were treated using seven modalities: total laryngectomy (TL, n = 30), TL with neck dissection (TL/ND, n = 40), conservation surgery alone (CS, n = 22), radiation therapy alone (RT, n = 29), TL combined with RT (TL/RT, n = 31), TL and ND combined with RT (TL/ND/RT, n = 36), and CS combined with RT (CS/RT, n = 12). The overall 5-year observed survival rate (OS) was 54% and the 5-year disease-specific survival rate (DSS) was 67%. The 5-year DSS for the individual treatment modalities included TL, 65.4%; TL/ND, 76.5%; CS, 71.4%; RT, 56.5%, TL/RT, 51.9%; TL/ND/RT, 71.4%; and CS/RT, 80%. There was no significant difference in DSS for any individual treatment modality (P =.375). The overall local and regional control rate was 74% (148 of 200). The overall recurrence rate was 37.5% with recurrence at the primary site and in the neck of 19.5% and 11%, respectively. Recurrence was not related to treatment modality. The 5-year DSS after treatment of recurrent cancer (salvage rate) was 35.8%. The incidence of distant metastasis was 11% and for second primary cancers it was 19.5%. There was no statistically significant difference in survival between necks initially treated (72%, 5-y DSS) versus necks observed and later treated if necessary (70%, 5-y DSS) (P =.797). CONCLUSIONS: The seven treatment modalities had statistically similar recurrence, complication, and survival rates. Patients with clear surgical margins have a significant survival advantage compared with patients with close and involved margins. Because postoperative radiation therapy in patients with positive margins did not improve survival, formal re-resection of the site of the positive margin should be considered. In patients whose N0 neck was not treated electively, close follow-up observation with meticulous examinations combined with appropriate treatment for subsequent neck disease resulted in a similar survival rate compared with those patients whose N0 necks were treated initially. Six-year minimum follow-up is recommended for early identification of primary and neck recurrence and for discovering expected second primary cancers. Patients treated with RT and CS had statistically similar rates of survival, maintenance of voice, and acquired permanent tracheal stoma. CS is a valid alternative to RT in treating highly selected patients with T3N0 glottic carcinoma.	4
17667539	Prognostic significance of isolated HMB45 or Melan A positive cells in Melanoma sentinel lymph nodes.	The detection of micrometastases (defined as groups of malignant cells) in the sentinel lymph node (SLN) is an important prognostic tool in melanoma. The use of immunohistochemistry with melanocytic markers such as HMB45 and Melan A increases the detection rate of micrometastases but there are also cases with isolated immunohistochemically positive cells (IPC). To determine the prognostic significance of isolated HMB45 and/or Melan A positive cells in melanoma SLN, we compared the clinical course of 47 patients with IPC to 308 patients with negative SLN and to 122 patients with micrometastases. The mean follow-up was 38.1 months. By Kaplan-Meier analyses, relapse free survival and overall survival of patients with IPC were similar to SLN negative patients, whereas patients with micrometastases had a significantly worse relapse free survival and overall survival. In the 47 patients with IPC, 6 relapses (12.8%) and 3 melanoma-related death (6.4%) occurred, in the SLN negative patients 36 relapses (11.7%) and 17 melanoma-related deaths (5.5%), in the patients with micrometastases 46 relapses (37.7%) and 29 melanoma-related deaths (23.8%). Prognosis of patients with IPC in SLN did not correlate with type of positive staining (HMB45, Melan A, or both), capsular involvement, number of cells, presence of cytologic atypias of IPC, or tumor penetrative depth. In conclusion, with short-term follow-up IPC in melanoma SLN are without prognostic significance.	2b
28472862	Three-dimensional saline infusion sonography compared to two-dimensional saline infusion sonography for the diagnosis of focal intracavitary lesions.	BACKGROUND: Focal abnormalities most commonly acquired within the uterine cavity include endometrial polyps (arising from the endometrium) and submucous fibroids (arising from the myometrium). These benign abnormalities can cause several problems, including abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) and subfertility. Two-dimensional saline infusion sonography (2D SIS) is a minimally invasive test that can be used to diagnose these pathologies, but it is less accurate than hysteroscopy, which is a more invasive procedure by which an endoscope allows direct visualisation of the uterine cavity. Three-dimensional (3D) SIS appears to enhance sonographic visualisation within the uterine cavity, thereby offering a potentially more accurate minimally invasive diagnostic test. OBJECTIVES: Primary objectives * To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of 3D SIS (index test 1) compared with 2D SIS for the diagnosis of focally growing lesions (presence or not) in women with AUB or subfertility, with hysteroscopy performed as the reference test. * To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of 2D+3D SIS (index test 2) compared with 2D SIS for the diagnosis of focally growing lesions (presence or not) in women with AUB or subfertility, with hysteroscopy performed as the reference test. In this case, any abnormality on either modality was regarded as a positive result ('OR' approach). Secondary objectives * To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of 3D SIS (index test 1) compared with 2D SIS according to type of abnormality and discrimination between uterine polyps and submucous fibroids in women with AUB or subfertility, with hysteroscopy and histology used as the reference.* To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of 2D+3D SIS (index test 2) compared with 2D SIS according to type of abnormality and discrimination between uterine polyps and submucous fibroids in women with AUB or subfertility, with hysteroscopy and histology used as the reference. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the following databases: Cochrane Central Register of Studies Online (CENTRAL CRSO), MEDLINE, Embase, PubMed, Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group (CGF) Specialised Register and CGFG Diagnostic Test Accuracy (DTA) Specialised Register, clinicaltrials.gov and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). Screening reference lists of appropriate studies was also performed. We screened for eligibility all studies identified from inception until March 2016. We performed searches with no date or language restrictions. SELECTION CRITERIA: The population of interest consisted of premenopausal women with AUB or subfertility and postmenopausal women with AUB. Diagnostic test accuracy studies, randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and prospective cohort studies were eligible for inclusion if they evaluated the accuracy of both 2D SIS and 3D SIS for the diagnosis of acquired intracavitary abnormalities with hysteroscopy used as the reference standard. In light of the lack of data for 3D SIS, we also included studies that evaluated the accuracy of 3D SIS alone. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors read all potentially eligible references after performing a first screening by title and abstract (LLN and FJRH). They independently extracted data to construct 2x2 tables from eligible studies and assessed studies for methodological quality using the QUADAS-2 tool (revised tool for quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies). To describe and visually present results, we produced in RevMan forest plots showing pairs of sensitivity and specificity together with 95% confidence intervals from each study, as well as raw receiver operating characteristic (ROC) plots. We displayed paired analyses in an ROC plot by linking sensitivity-specificity pairs from each study by using a dashed line. To compare 3D SIS versus 2D SIS, we restricted analyses to studies that provided 2x2 tables for both tests and used the bivariate meta-analysis of sensitivity and specificity. MAIN RESULTS: Thirteen studies (1053 women) reported the accuracy of 3D SIS for focal uterine abnormalities; 11 of these (846 women) were suitable for meta-analysis, and eight reported accuracy according to the type of focal abnormality. The design of the included studies seems applicable. The main problem involving the quality of included studies is insufficient reporting of study methods, resulting in unclear risk of bias for several of the quality domains assessed. Therefore, we considered the overall quality of the evidence as low. The summary estimate (11 studies reporting absence or presence of abnormality at 3D SIS) for sensitivity was 94.5% (95% confidence interval (CI) 90.6% to 96.9%) and for specificity 99.4% (95% CI 96.2% to 99.9%). Meta-analysis of the eight studies (N = 716) directly comparing 2D SIS versus 3D SIS showed summary sensitivity of 96.9% (95% CI 91.9% to 98.8%) and summary specificity of 99.5% (95% CI 96.1% to 100%) for 3D SIS. For 2D SIS, summary sensitivity was 90.9% (95% CI 81.2% to 95.8%) and summary specificity was 96.3% (95% CI 86.1% to 99.1%). The difference in accuracy between 2D SIS and 3D SIS was non-significant (P values of 0.07 for sensitivity and 0.10 for specificity). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Low-quality evidence suggests that 3D SIS may be very accurate in detecting intracavitary abnormalities. Meta-analysis revealed no statistically significant differences between 2D SIS and 3D SIS. Summary sensitivity and summary specificity are higher for 3D SIS, but margins of improvement are limited because 2D SIS is already very accurate. When the technology and appropriate expertise are available, 3D SIS offers an alternative to 2D SIS. Both 2D SIS and 3D SIS should be considered alternatives to diagnostic hysteroscopy when intracavitary pathology is suspected in subfertile women and in those with abnormal uterine bleeding.	2a
8628086	Comparison of clinical evaluation and computed tomographic diagnostic accuracy for tumors of the larynx and hypopharynx.	Ninety-five patients with laryngeal and hypopharyngeal cancer were examined and staged preoperatively by clinical evaluation (CE) and computed tomography (CT). The CE and CT staging were compared to each other and to the pathologic (PT) staging of the tumors. The CT staging showed high accuracy in staging transglottic (88%), supraglottic (68%), and oropharyngeal tumors invading the larynx (68%) when compared to the PT findings. The CT staging was less effective in evaluating glottic tumors (46%), both overstaging (12%) and understaging (20%) cases. Combined CE-CT evaluation showed higher accuracy in staging all tumors (84%) compared to CE alone (52%) or CT alone (68%). The findings suggest that combined CE-CT should be used to evaluate laryngeal and hypopharyngeal tumors.	4
31978437	Progestin therapy for obese women with complex atypical hyperplasia: levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine device vs systemic therapy.	BACKGROUND: Though hysterectomy remains the standard treatment for complex atypical hyperplasia, patients who desire fertility or who are poor surgical candidates may opt for progestin therapy. However, the effectiveness of the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine device compared to systemic therapy in the treatment of complex atypical hyperplasia has not been well studied. OBJECTIVE: We sought to examine differences in treatment response between local progestin therapy with the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine device and systemic progestin therapy in women with complex atypical hyperplasia. METHODS: This single-institution retrospective study examined women with complex atypical hyperplasia who received progestin therapy between 2003 and 2018. Treatment response was assessed by histopathology on subsequent biopsies. Time-dependent analyses of complete response and progression to cancer were performed comparing the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine device and systemic therapy. A propensity score inverse probability of treatment weighting model was used to create a weighted cohort that differed based on treatment type but was similar with respect to other characteristics. An interaction-term analysis was performed to examine the impact of body habitus on treatment response, and an interrupted time-series analysis was employed to assess if changes in treatment patterns correlated with outcomes over time. RESULTS: A total of 245 women with complex atypical hyperplasia received progestin therapy (levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine device n = 69 and systemic therapy n = 176). The mean age and body mass index were 36.9 years and 40.0 kg/m(2), respectively. In the patient-level analysis, women who received the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine device had higher rates of complete response (78.7% vs 46.7%; adjusted hazard ratio, 3.32; 95% confidence interval, 2.39-4.62) and a lower likelihood of progression to cancer (4.5% vs 15.7%; adjusted hazard ratio, 0.28; 95% confidence interval, 0.11-0.73) compared to those who received systemic therapy. In particular, women with class III obesity derived a higher relative benefit from levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine device therapy in achieving complete response compared to systemic therapy: class III obesity, adjusted hazard ratio 4.72, 95% confidence interval 2.83-7.89; class I-II obesity, adjusted hazard ratio 1.83, 95% confidence interval 1.09-3.09; and nonobese, adjusted hazard ratio 1.26, 95% confidence interval 0.40-3.95. In the cohort-level analysis, the obesity rate increased during the study period (77.8% to 88.2%, 13.4% relative increase, P = .033) and levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine device use significantly increased after 2007 (6.3% to 82.7%, 13.2-fold increase, P < .001), both concomitant with a higher proportion of women achieving complete response (32.9% to 81.4%, 2.5-fold increase, P = .005). CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that local therapy with the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine device may be more effective than systemic therapy for women with complex atypical hyperplasia who opt for nonsurgical treatment, particularly in morbidly obese women. Shifts in treatment paradigm during the study period toward increased levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine device use also led to improved complete response rates despite increasing rates of obesity.	3a
15197809	The role of preoperative endorectal magnetic resonance imaging in the decision regarding whether to preserve or resect neurovascular bundles during radical retropubic prostatectomy.	BACKGROUND: Because the recovery of erectile function and the avoidance of positive surgical margins are important but competing outcomes, the decision to preserve or resect a neurovascular bundle (NVB) during radical prostatectomy (RP) should be based on the most accurate information concerning the location and extent of the tumor. In the current study, the authors determined the incremental value of endorectal magnetic resonance imaging (eMRI) in making this decision. METHODS: eMRI was performed in 135 patients preoperatively. For each NVB, tumor extension to the NVB and the need for NVB resection was judged by a surgeon on a scale from 1 (definite preservation) to 5 (definite resection) before and after reviewing eMRI with a radiologist. Histopathologic findings were used as the standard of reference. The value of eMRI was assessed using binormal receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis adjusted for multiple observations per patient, and a mixed effects ordinal regression model was used for risk stratification. RESULTS: Histopathologic examination determined that NVB resection was warranted in 44 of 270 NVBs (16%) because of posterolateral extracapsular extension (n = 29), positive surgical margins (n = 7), or both (n = 8). The areas under the ROC curves (AUC) were 0.741 for pre-MRI and 0.832 for post-MRI surgical planning (P < 0.01). MRI findings suggested altering the surgical plan in 39% of NVBs (106 of 270 NVBs). When the surgeon judged that the NVB resection was definitely not necessary (165 NVBs), MRI confirmed that decision in 138 NVBs (84%); the concordant decision was correct in 96% of the cases (133 of 138 NVBs). In 36 high-risk patients (> or = 75% probability of extracapsular extension), MRI findings changed the surgical plan for 28 NVBs (78%); the change was found to be appropriate in 26 cases (93%). CONCLUSIONS: MRI was found to significantly improve the surgeon's decision to preserve or resect the NVB during radical prostatectomy.	2a
29747074	High-dose zinc oral supplementation after stem cell transplantation causes an increase of TRECs and CD4+ naive lymphocytes and prevents TTV reactivation.	INTRODUCTION: Zinc plays an important role in thymic function and immune homeostasis. We performed a prospective clinical trial using a high-dose zinc oral supplementation to improve the immune reconstitution after hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). PATIENTS AND METHODS: We enrolled 18 patients undergoing autologous HSCT for multiple myeloma. Nine patients were randomized to receive only a standard antimicrobial prophylaxis; whereas, nine patients received in addition 150mg/day of zinc from day +5 to day +100 after transplant. RESULTS: CD4+ naive lymphocytes and TRECs showed a significant increase from day +30 until day +100 only in the zinc-treated group. Moreover, the load of Torquetenovirus, a harmless virus that replicates in course of immunedepression, increased at day +100 only in the control group. No severe adverse events were reported during the zinc consumption. CONCLUSION: First data from the ZENITH trial suggest that high-dose zinc supplementation is safe and may enhance the thymic reconstitution after HSCT.

24996052	Treatment of in-transit melanoma with intra-lesional interleukin-2: a systematic review.	BACKGROUND: Several phase II studies have assessed intra-lesional interleukin-2 (IL-2) for the treatment of in-transit melanoma. This systematic review addresses the efficacy and side effect profile of IL-2. METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar databases were searched from 1980 to 2012 for studies evaluating the clinical response to IL-2 for in-transit melanoma. Titles and abstracts were screened by two independent researchers for suitability using predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria. A modified quality assessment tool for observational studies was used. Data were pooled and analyzed to determine lesion and patient response rates. RESULTS: Forty-nine studies were identified. Forty-three did not meet inclusion criteria, leaving six observational trials. Heterogeneity was seen in IL-2 dosage and treatment interval. Response rate was variable as well. Overall, 2,182 lesions and 140 patients were treated in these six studies. Pooling the lesions, complete response was seen in 78%. Pooling subjects, 50% achieved a complete response. Treatment was generally well tolerated, with localized pain and swelling, and mild flu-like symptoms. There were only three grade 3 adverse events reported, including rigors, headache, and fever with arthralgia. CONCLUSIONS: Intra-lesional IL-2 safely and effectively provides locoregional control of in-transit melanoma.	2a
26111957	Effect of single doses of IV palonosetron, up to 2.25 mg, on the QTc interval duration: a double-blind, randomized, parallel group study in healthy volunteers.	PURPOSE: The use of serotonin type 3 (5-HT3) receptor antagonists (RAs) in the prevention of nausea and vomiting caused by emetogenic chemotherapy is part of a comprehensive management strategy for patients undergoing chemotherapy. Electrocardiographic effects have been reported in patients after intravenous administration of 5-HT3 RAs. The present study investigated the electrocardiogram (ECG) profile of the 5-HT3 RA palonosetron following International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) E14 Guidelines. METHODS: A total of 221 healthy subjects (101 females, 120 males) were randomized in this phase I, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel group study and assigned to one of five treatments: placebo, palonosetron (0.25, 0.75, or 2.25 mg), or moxifloxacin (400 mg). ECGs were recorded for 24 h pre-dosing until 48 h post-dose. The primary endpoint was the placebo time-matched and baseline-subtracted individual QTc interval prolongation (DeltaDeltaQTcI). RESULTS: The QTc interval was not prolonged after administration of palonosetron (DeltaDeltaQTcI upper confidence interval was <10 ms for all time points in all palonosetron treatment groups). Assay sensitivity was confirmed with the expected change in the QTc interval after administration of the positive control moxifloxacin. CONCLUSIONS: Palonosetron, even at supratherapeutic doses, has no effect on cardiac repolarization as measured by the QTc interval in a validated controlled clinical trial.	1b
22035662	Adjuvant radiotherapy for palpable melanoma metastases to the groin: when to irradiate?	PURPOSE: To determine the efficacy of and criteria for postoperative radiotherapy (PORT) in patients with palpable melanoma metastases to the groin. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Patients with palpable metastases to the groin who were treated with therapeutic nodal dissection during 2000 to 2006 were identified in a prospective institutional database. RESULTS: In 101 patients, 103 therapeutic nodal dissections were performed; 37 of these were treated with PORT to a median equivalent dose (eqTD(2)) of 50.6 Gy (range, 50-72 Gy). In the surgery-only and PORT groups, 2-year regional control rates were 86% (95% confidence interval [CI] 76-95%) and 91% (95% CI, 81-100%), respectively (p = 0.395). Of five recurrences in radiation-treated patients, four were of dermal type, and in three of these cases, no bolus over the operative scar was used. PORT improved 2-year regional control (46% [95% CI, 11-82%] vs. 82% [95% CI, 63-100%], p = 0.022) among patients in which the sum of risk factors present (i.e., risk factor score) was >/=2. In multivariate analysis, risk-factor score (<2 vs. >/=2: HR, 2.93; 95% CI, 1.00-8.56; p < 0.0001) and PORT (yes vs. no: HR, 7.81; 95% CI, 2.83-21.74; p = 0.050) was predictive for regional control and on logistic-regression testing, number of involved lymph nodes was predictive for systemic dissemination (p = 0.011). CONCLUSIONS: PORT should follow therapeutic nodal dissection in cases with two or more adverse factors. More conventional fractionation (</=2.5 Gy), cumulative eqTD(2) <60 Gy and use of bolus over the operative scar are recommended.	3b
25686117	Randomized controlled trial on the skin toxicity of panitumumab in Japanese patients with metastatic colorectal cancer: HGCSG1001 study; J-STEPP.	AIM: We planned a randomized, open-label trial to evaluate differences between pre-emptive and reactive skin treatment for panitumumab (Pmab)-associated skin toxicities in Japanese patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. PATIENTS & METHODS: Patients receiving third-line Pmab-containing regimens were randomized to pre-emptive or reactive treatment. The primary end point was the cumulative incidence of >/=grade 2 skin toxicities during 6 weeks. Retrospectively, a dermatologist reviewed skin toxicities, in a blinded manner. RESULTS: A total of 95 patients were enrolled (pre-emptive: 47, reactive: 48). The primary end point was achieved (21.3 and 62.5% [risk ratio: 0.34; p < 0.001], for pre-emptive and reactive treatment, respectively). A similar trend was observed in central review. CONCLUSION: Pre-emptive skin treatment could reduce the severity of Pmab-associated skin toxicities in Japanese metastatic colorectal cancer patients.	1b
19725289	Laparoscopic and open distal pancreatectomy: a comparison of outcomes.	Laparoscopic (lap) pancreatic surgery has been increasingly reported since its introduction in 1992. A retrospective analysis of consecutive patients undergoing elective lap and open distal pancreatectomy from 2002 to 2007 was performed. Univariate analysis was completed to evaluate perioperative variables. Logistic regression analysis was used to model predictors of postoperative pancreatic fistula. One hundred forty-eight subjects underwent distal pancreatectomy; 98 completed open, 44 lap, and six converted to open. There was no significant difference in the incidence of postoperative morbidity or mortality between the surgical approaches. Decreased operative time (156 vs 200 minutes, P < 0.01), blood loss (157 vs 719 mL, P < 0.01), and length of stay (5.9 vs 8.6 days, P < 0.01) were seen in the lap group. There was no significant difference in the rate of all pancreatic fistula formation (50 vs 46%, P = 0.94) or clinically significant leaks (18 vs 19%, P = 0.97) between techniques. A preoperative biopsy-proven cancer, increasing body mass index, history of pancreatitis, and male gender were significant predictors of having a pancreatic fistula. Lap and open distal pancreatectomy are performed safely at high-volume pancreatic surgery centers. This report provides ongoing support of the feasibility and safety of the lap approach with improved perioperative outcomes and equivalent pancreatic fistula rate.	4
23527527	Impact of a facial-ageing intervention versus a health literature intervention on women's sun protection attitudes and behavioural intentions.	This study was designed to investigate the impact of a facial-ageing intervention on women's sun protection attitudes and behavioural intentions, compared to a health literature intervention where participants viewed literature on the effect of ultraviolet (UV) exposure on health. Seventy women (35 in each condition) completed questionnaires at baseline and immediately post-intervention. The average age of the participants was 23.70 (SD = 5.03) years. Participants in the facial-ageing intervention condition scored significantly higher on intentions, negative attitudes and perceived sun damage susceptibility after taking part in the intervention, compared to those in the health literature intervention condition. The results are discussed in relation to suggestions for sun protection interventions aimed at women aged from 18 to 34. It is concluded that appearance-based interventions have a role to play in healthcare and educational settings with regard to UV exposure and sun protection intentions.	1b
8080670	Efficacy and tolerance of oral dipyrone versus oral morphine for cancer pain.	In a double-blind, randomised and parallel clinical trial, two oral doses of dipyrone (1 and 2 g) administered every 8 h were compared with 10 mg of oral morphine given every 4 h for the relief of chronic cancer pain. A total of 121 patients with cancer pain without gastric involvement participated in a 7-day treatment course and were allocated to receive either dipyrone 1 g (n = 41), dipyrone 2 g (n = 38) or morphine (n = 42). Drug efficacy was analysed according to the degree of pain relief using a 100-mm visual analogue scale, and the number of patients who decided to increase the dose of the analgesic drug on day 4. The analgesic effect of dipyrone, 2 g every 8 h, was similar to that of morphine. The efficacy of both schedules was significantly greater than that of dipyrone, 1 g every 8 h. Dipyrone at either 1 or 2 g doses tended to be better tolerated than morphine, although the differences were not statistically significant.	1b
11489708	Assessment of the risk of positive surgical margins with pelvic phased-array magnetic resonance imaging in patients with clinically localized prostate cancer: a prospective study.	OBJECTIVES: We assessed magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performance in the prediction of positive surgical margins (PSMs) before radical prostatectomy in a prospective study correlating the MRI results and pathologic findings. METHODS: Between January 1995 and December 1999, 176 patients (mean age 64.2 years, range 49 to 75), with localized prostate cancer (49 with Stage T1 and 127 with Stage T2) underwent preoperative MRI with a pelvic phased-array coil (Tesla-1, Siemens) at a mean interval of 35 days after randomized transrectal biopsies. The mean preoperative prostate-specific antigen level was 10.9 ng/mL (range 1.2 to 39). The MRI studies and specimen analysis were performed by one radiologist unaware of the clinical and biopsy findings and by one pathologist, respectively. Multivariate analysis was performed to compare the predictive value of MRI staging, prostate-specific antigen value, and preoperative Gleason score to identify the PSM rate. RESULTS: Of the 176 patients, 131 (74%) had Stage T2 disease by MRI and 45 (26%) Stage T3 disease by MRI. Pathologic staging showed 103 with pT2 and 73 with pT3. Overall, the PSM rate of the series was 18%. The PSM rate was 13.7% and 31% for patients with T2 and T3 disease by MRI, respectively. For the T3 MRI cases, the PSM rate was 2.32-fold higher. MRI staging, like the prostate-specific antigen value, was a predictive factor of PSMs (P = 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study show that preoperative MRI staging with the phased-array coil may be helpful in predicting the PSM risk in radical prostatectomy candidates with clinically localized prostate cancer.	2b
19395188	Retrospective comparison of external beam radiotherapy and radical prostatectomy in high-risk, clinically localized prostate cancer.	PURPOSE: Because of the lack of conclusive and well-conducted randomized studies, the optimal therapy for prostate tumors remains controversial. The aim of this study was to retrospectively compare the results of radical surgery vs. a conservative approach such as external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) plus androgen deprivation therapy using an intent-to-treat analysis on two pretreatment defined, concurrently treated, high-risk patient populations. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between January 2003 and December 2007, 162 patients with high-risk prostate cancer underwent an EBRT plus androgen deprivation therapy program at the RT department of our institute. In the same period, 122 patients with the same high-risk disease underwent radical prostatectomy (RP) at the urologic department of our institute. Patients with adverse pathologic factors also underwent adjuvant EBRT with or without androgen deprivation therapy. The primary endpoint was freedom from biochemical failure. RESULTS: The two groups of high-risk patients were homogeneous in terms of freedom from biochemical failure on the basis of the clinical T stage, biopsy Gleason score, and initial prostate-specific antigen level. The median follow-up was 38.6 and 33.8 months in the EBRT and RP groups, respectively. The actuarial analysis of the freedom from biochemical failure showed a 3-year rate of 86.8% and 69.8% in the EBRT and RP group, respectively (p = .001). Multivariate analysis of the whole group revealed the initial prostate-specific antigen level and treatment type (EBRT vs. RP) as significant covariates. CONCLUSION: This retrospective intention-to-treat analysis showed a significantly better outcome after EBRT than after RP in patients with high-risk prostate cancer, although a well-conducted randomized comparison would be the best procedure to confirm these results.	2b
8819128	Clinical responses and lymphoid infiltrates in metastatic melanoma following treatment with intralesional GM-CSF.	Past studies in animal models with gene-transfected tumour cells have suggested that GM-CSF may have a role in immunotherapy of tumours as a result of the effects it has on antigen-presenting cells. The present (phase I) studies were carried out to examine whether intralesional injections of GM-CSF induce regression of subcutaneous metastases in patients with melanoma and influence lymphoid infiltrates in and around the metastases. Thirteen patients had 15-50 mg doses of GM-CSF injected into two subcutaneous metastases. In each case one metastasis received only five injections before excision whereas the other received weekly injections up to 6 months. Partial regression of injected and/or non-injected metastases was seen in three patients. The metastases from the responding patients that were treated with intralesional GM-CSF had marked increases and high absolute numbers of T cell infiltrates into the tumour, particularly of the CD4 T cell subset. There was an increase in IL-2R expression on the T cells and an increase in the number of Langerhans' cells infiltrating the tumours. The best predictors of clinical responses therefore appeared to be high relative increases and high absolute numbers of CD4+ T cells and Langerhans' cells within the treated tumour. These results provide support for further exploration of the role of GM-CSF in immunotherapy of human melanoma.	4
18467732	Interventions for alleviating cancer-related dyspnea: a systematic review.	PURPOSE: Dyspnea is one of the most distressing symptoms experienced by terminally ill cancer patients. This study aimed to evaluate the role of interventions for the palliation of dyspnea. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of randomized controlled trials assessing all pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions for dyspnea palliation in cancer patients, and searched the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, conference proceedings, and references. Two reviewers independently appraised the quality of trials and extracted data. RESULTS: Our search yielded 18 trials. Fourteen evaluated pharmacologic interventions: seven assessing opioids (a total of 256 patients), five assessing oxygen (137 patients), one assessing helium-enriched air, and one assessing furosemide. Four trials evaluated nonpharmacologic interventions (403 patients). The administration of subcutaneous morphine resulted in a significant reduction in dyspnea Visual Analog Scale (VAS) compared with placebo. No difference was observed in dyspnea VAS score when nebulized morphine was compared with subcutaneous morphine, although patients preferred the nebulized route. The addition of benzodiazepines to morphine was significantly more effective than morphine alone, without additional adverse effects. Oxygen was not superior to air for alleviating dyspnea, except for patients with hypoxemia. Nursing-led interventions improved breathlessness. Acupuncture was not beneficial. CONCLUSION: Our review supports the use of opioids for dyspnea relief in cancer patients. The use of supplemental oxygen to alleviate dyspnea can be recommended only in patients with hypoxemia. Nursing-led nonpharmacologic interventions seem valuable. Only a few studies addressing this question were performed. Thus, further studies evaluating interventions for alleviating dyspnea are warranted.	1a
15714120	Treatment of metastatic melanoma using electroporation therapy with bleomycin (electrochemotherapy).	Electroporation therapy (EPT) is a novel treatment modality that uses brief, high-intensity, pulsed electrical currents to enhance the uptake of chemotherapeutic agents, vaccines and genes into cells. This technique is potentially useful for patients with secondary and, possibly, some primary tumours. Nineteen patients with metastatic melanoma were enrolled in a phase two, randomized, open-label study comparing intralesional bleomycin+EPT with intralesional bleomycin alone. Of 18 study lesions, 13 (72%) showed a complete response, one (5%) showed a partial response, three (18%) showed no change and one (5%) showed disease progression over a period of greater than 12 weeks. This represents a 78% objective response rate, which was significantly greater than the 32% response rate observed in the 19 patients with tumours treated with intralesional bleomycin alone (chi=7.94, 1 df, P=0.005). An additional 36 lesions, not enrolled in the study, were also treated with bleomycin+EPT. Of the total of 54 lesions treated with bleomycin+EPT, there was a 72% objective response rate. EPT treatment was well tolerated and was performed on an outpatient basis.	4
12873666	Dose-response for biochemical control among high-risk prostate cancer patients after external beam radiotherapy.	INTRODUCTION: The literature on dose-response characteristics of high-risk prostate cancer has been scarce in this era, when these patients are treated with hormone therapy along with radiotherapy. In this study, we estimated the dose-response of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) control probability in high-risk prostate cancer patients treated with radiotherapy alone. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The data set contains information on 363 high-risk prostate cancer patients who were treated with external beam radiotherapy without hormonal treatment between February 1987 and September 1998. These patients have one or more of the following adverse prognostic features: digital rectal examination stage > or =cT3, PSA >20 ng/mL, and biopsy Gleason score > or =8. These patients had biopsy-proven adenocarcinoma of prostate and were staged according to the 1992 AJCC staging system that was based on digital rectal examination. The logistic model was fitted to the data at various time points after treatment, and the dose-response parameters were estimated. RESULTS: The dose required to have 50% tumor control, TCD50 (95% confidence interval), for high-risk patients is 75.5 (range: 70.7-80.2) Gy. The gamma 50 (95% confidence interval) is 1.7 (range: 0.7-2.7) around 75.5 Gy. Recursive partitioning analysis based on the null Martingale residuals identifies two subgroups within the high-risk group. The TCD50 estimates of the two subgroups (PSA < or = vs. >20 ng/mL) differ by 15 Gy at 5 years. There is a dose response in both subgroups. CONCLUSION: We recognize that this study has the usual limitations of a retrospective study that includes treatment policy change that spanned a long time frame. However, our data strongly suggest a benefit of dose escalation for all the patients in the entire high-risk group. There is a steep dose response in PSA control probability around a modern dose of 78 Gy. A 5-Gy dose increase beyond 78 Gy may improve PSA control by about 10%.	2b
18333732	Impact of an inpatient palliative care team: a randomized control trial.	BACKGROUND: Palliative care improves care and reduces costs for hospitalized patients with life-limiting illnesses. There have been no multicenter randomized trials examining impact on patient satisfaction, clinical outcomes, and subsequent health care costs. OBJECTIVE: Measure the impact of an interdisciplinary palliative care service (IPCS) on patient satisfaction, clinical outcomes, and cost of care for 6 months posthospital discharge. METHODS: Multicenter, randomized, controlled trial. IPCS provided consultative, interdisciplinary, palliative care to intervention patients. Controls received usual hospital care (UC). SETTING AND SAMPLE: Five hundred seventeen patients with life-limiting illnesses from a hospital in Denver, Portland, and San Francisco enrolled June 2002 to December 2003. MEASURES: Modified City of Hope Patient Questionnaire, total health care costs, hospice utilization, and survival. RESULTS: IPCS reported higher scores for the Care Experience scale (IPCS: 6.9 versus UC: 6.6, p = 0.04) and for the Doctors, Nurses/Other Care Providers Communication scale (IPCS: 8.3 versus UC: 7.5, p = 0.0004). IPCS patients had fewer intensive care admissions (ICU) on hospital readmission (12 versus 21, p = 0.04), and lower 6-month net cost savings of $4,855 per patient (p = 0.001). IPCS had longer median hospice stays (24 days versus 12 days, p = 0.04). There were no differences in survival or symptom control. CONCLUSIONS: IPCS patients reported greater satisfaction with their care experience and providers' communication, had fewer ICU admissions on readmission, and lower total health care costs following hospital discharge.	1a
18327706	A randomized study of aprepitant, ondansetron and dexamethasone for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting in Chinese breast cancer patients receiving moderately emetogenic chemotherapy.	OBJECTIVES: This is a single center, randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled study to evaluate the NK(1)-receptor antagonist, aprepitant, in Chinese breast cancer patients. The primary objective was to compare the efficacy of aprepitant-based antiemetic regimen and standard antiemetic regimen for the prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) in patients who received moderately emetogenic chemotherapy. The secondary objective was to compare the patient-reported quality of life in these two groups of patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eligible breast cancer patients were chemotherapy-naive and treated with adjuvant AC chemotherapy (i.e. doxorubicin 60 mg/m(2) and cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m(2)). Patients were randomly assigned to either an aprepitant-based regimen (day 1, aprepitant 125 mg, ondansetron 8 mg, and dexamethasone 12 mg before chemotherapy and ondansetron 8 mg 8 h later; days 2 through 3, aprepitant 80 qd) or a control arm which consisted of standard regimen (day 1, ondansetron 8 mg and dexamethasone 20 mg before chemotherapy and ondansetron 8 mg 8 h later; days 2 through 3, ondansetron 8 mg bid). Data on nausea, vomiting, and use of rescue medication were collected with a self-report diary, patients quality of life were assessed by self-administered Functional Living Index-Emesis (FLIE). RESULTS: Of 127 patients randomized, 124 were assessable. For CINV in Cycle 1 AC, there was no significant difference in the proportion of patients with reported complete response, complete protection, total control, 'no vomiting', 'no significant nausea' and 'no nausea'. The requirement of rescue medication appears to be lesser in patients treated with the aprepitant-based regimen compared to those with the standard regimen (11% vs. 20%; P = 0.06). Assessment of FLIE revealed that while there was no difference in the nausea domain and the total score between the two groups; however, patients receiving standard antiemetic regimen had significantly worse quality of life in the vomiting domain (mean score [SD] = 23.99 [30.79]) when compared with those who received the aprepitant-based regimen (mean score [SD] = 3.40 [13.18]) (P = 0.0002). Both treatments were generally well tolerated. Patients treated with the aprepitant-based regimen had a significantly lower incidence of neutropenia (53.2% vs. 35.5%, P = 0.0468), grade >or= 3 neutropenia (21.0% vs. 45.2, P = 0.0042) and delay in subsequent cycle of chemotherapy (8.1% vs. 27.4%, P = 0.0048). CONCLUSION: The aprepitant regimen appears to reduce the requirement of rescue medication when compared with the control regimen for prevention of CINV in patients receiving both an anthracycline and cyclophosphamide, and is associated with a better quality of life during adjuvant AC chemotherapy.	1b
19581537	Phase III, randomized study of gemcitabine and oxaliplatin versus gemcitabine (fixed-dose rate infusion) compared with gemcitabine (30-minute infusion) in patients with pancreatic carcinoma E6201: a trial of the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group.	PURPOSE: Single-agent gemcitabine (GEM) is standard treatment of metastatic pancreatic cancer. Fixed-dose rate (FDR) GEM and GEM plus oxaliplatin have shown promise in early clinical trials. E6201 was designed to compare overall survival (OS) of standard weekly GEM 1,000 mg/m(2)/30 minutes versus GEM FDR 1,500 mg/m(2)/150 minutes or GEM 1,000 mg/m(2)/100 minutes/day 1 plus oxaliplatin 100 mg/m(2)/day 2 every 14 days (GEMOX). METHODS: This trial included patients with metastatic or locally advanced pancreatic cancer, normal organ function, and performance status of 0 to 2. The study was designed to detect a 33% difference in median survival (hazard ratio [HR] < or = 0.75 for either of the experimental arms) with 81% power while maintaining a significance level of 2.5% in a two-sided test for each of the two primary comparisons. RESULTS: Eight hundred thirty-two patients were enrolled. The median survival and 1-year survival were 4.9 months (95% CI, 4.5 to 5.6) and 16% for GEM, 6.2 months (95% CI, 5.4 to 6.9), and 21% for GEM FDR (HR, 0.83; stratified log-rank P = .04), and 5.7 months (95% CI, 4.9 to 6.5) and 21% for GEMOX (HR, 0.88; stratified log-rank P = .22). Neither of these differences met the prespecified criteria for significance. Survival was 9.2 months for patients with locally advanced disease, and 5.4 months for those with metastatic disease. Grade 3/4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia were greatest with GEM FDR. GEMOX caused higher rates of nausea, vomiting, and neuropathy. CONCLUSION: Neither GEM FDR nor GEMOX resulted in substantially improved survival or symptom benefit over standard GEM in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer.	1b
21332457	Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography fails to detect distant metastases at initial staging of melanoma patients with metastatic involvement of sentinel lymph node.	BACKGROUND: Positron emission tomography (PET) using fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) has proven to be more sensitive and accurate than other imaging modalities for the detection of distant metastases in patients with melanoma. Sentinel lymph node (SLN) status is the most important prognostic factor in melanoma patients with no evidence of distant metastasis. OBJECTIVES: To assess the rate of distant metastases in patients with a positive SLN biopsy (SLNB). METHODS: Forty-six consecutive patients with a positive SLNB underwent PET or PET-computed tomography within 6 weeks of the SLNB procedure. The patients did not present any clinical sign of nodal involvement or of distant metastasis. PET findings were classified as positive, negative or nonconclusive. RESULTS: No patient had a positive PET scan for distant metastasis. Six patients (13%) had a nonconclusive PET scan; none of them presented distant metastasis within 12 months. Forty patients (87%) had a negative PET scan; among them five (12%) presented with distant metastasis within 12 months. CONCLUSIONS: Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography failed to detect distant metastases at initial staging in patients with a positive SLNB, even in patients who presented with distant metastases within 12 months after the FDG PET scan. These results could be explained by the low prevalence of macroscopic metastatic disease at this stage and by the important delay between the onset of the spread of microscopic metastatic disease and the identification by PET scan of macroscopic metastatic disease.	3b
19249998	Yoga therapy decreases dyspnea-related distress and improves functional performance in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a pilot study.	BACKGROUND: There has been limited study of yoga training as a complementary exercise strategy to manage the symptom of dyspnea in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). PURPOSE: The primary purpose of this pilot study was to evaluate a yoga program for its safety, feasibility, and efficacy for decreasing dyspnea intensity (DI) and dyspnea-related distress (DD) in older adults with COPD. METHODS: Clinically stable patients with COPD (n = 29; age 69.9 +/- 9.5; forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV(1)) 47.7 +/- 15.6% predicted; female = 21) were randomized to a 12-week yoga program specifically designed for people with COPD or usual-care control (UC). The twice-weekly yoga program included asanas (yoga postures) and visama vritti pranayama (timed breathing). Safety measure outcomes included heart rate, oxygen saturation, dyspnea, and pain. Feasibility was measured by patient-reported enjoyment, difficulty, and adherence to yoga sessions. At baseline and at 12 weeks, DI and DD were measured during incremental cycle ergometry and a 6-minute walk (6MW) test. Secondary efficacy outcomes included physical performance, psychologic well-being, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL). RESULTS: Yoga training was safe and feasible for patients with COPD. While yoga training had only small effects on DI after the 6MW test (effect size [ES], 0.20; p = 0.60), there were greater reductions in DD in the yoga group compared to UC (ES, 0.67; p = 0.08). Yoga training also improved 6MW distance (+71.7 +/- 21.8 feet versus -27.6 +/- 36.2 feet; ES = 0.78, p = 0.04) and self-reported functional performance (ES = 0.79, p = 0.04) compared to UC. There were small positive changes in muscle strength and HRQoL. CONCLUSIONS: Elderly patients with COPD participated safely in a 12-week yoga program especially designed for patients with this chronic illness. After the program, the subjects tolerated more activity with less DD and improved their functional performance. These findings need to be confirmed in a larger, more sufficiently powered efficacy study.	1b
15302691	Routine imaging of asymptomatic melanoma patients with metastasis to sentinel lymph nodes rarely identifies systemic disease.	HYPOTHESIS: The diagnostic yield of chest radiography; computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis; and CT or magnetic resonance imaging of the brain in the initial evaluation of melanoma with metastasis to sentinel lymph nodes may not identify systemic disease. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis. SETTING: Tertiary care referral center. PATIENTS: Of 1183 patients identified from a database of individuals who underwent selective sentinel lymphadenectomy for primary melanoma (Breslow thickness, 0.2-30 mm), we studied 185 with at least 1 sentinel lymph node positive for metastatic melanoma (Breslow thickness, 0.8-14.5 mm). INTERVENTIONS: Chest radiography; CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis; and CT or magnetic resonance imaging of the brain after selective sentinel lymphadenectomy with positive sentinel lymph nodes. The medical records of the 185 patients were systematically reviewed by 4 physician reviewers, and data were extracted primarily from pathology and radiology reports. When medical records were unavailable, information was taken from formal clinic and inpatient progress notes. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Diagnostic yield of imaging studies. RESULTS: The results of 0.5% of the imaging studies were positive for metastatic disease, 86% were negative, and 14% were indeterminate. Indeterminate results were confirmed to be negative by additional studies ranging from repeated imaging to invasive procedures, including thoracotomy and brain biopsy. The yields are as follows: chest radiography, 0%; chest CT, 0.7%; abdominal and pelvic CT, 0.7%; brain CT, 0%; and brain magnetic resonance imaging, 0%. Only 1 patient (0.5%) had detectable metastatic disease, and he had symptoms of systemic disease at the time of imaging. CONCLUSIONS: Computed tomography of the chest, abdomen and pelvis, and brain rarely reveals systemic metastasis at the time of selective sentinel lymphadenectomy. Routine imaging of asymptomatic patients at the time of selective sentinel lymphadenectomy is not indicated.	3b
11167684	Should adjuvant radiotherapy be recommended following resection of regional lymph node metastases of malignant melanomas?	BACKGROUND: Several authors have recommended adjuvant radiotherapy following resection of regional lymph node metastases in cutaneous malignant melanoma. There is, however, little evidence from controlled trials that patients benefit from this treatment. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the usefulness of adjuvant radiotherapy following resection of lymph node metastases in cutaneous malignant melanoma. METHODS: We performed a retrospective study comparing 58 patients who underwent radiotherapy following resection of regional lymph node metastases with 58 controls from another centre who exclusively underwent regional lymphadenectomy. Patients and their controls were matched with respect to the number of tumour-bearing lymph nodes (1 vs. > 1) and to gender, although the proportion of thick tumours was greater in the irradiation group. RESULTS: The overall survival curves were almost identical in the two groups. There were nine disease recurrences in the study group and 12 in the control group (not significant). Regional recurrences in the irradiated patients were usually accompanied by metastases at other sites. CONCLUSIONS: The present study does not support the recommendation of adjuvant radiotherapy following resection of regional lymph node metastases in patients with malignant melanoma.	3b
27466265	Local Tumor Treatment in Combination with Systemic Ipilimumab Immunotherapy Prolongs Overall Survival in Patients with Advanced Malignant Melanoma.	Immune checkpoint inhibition with ipilimumab has revolutionized cancer immunotherapy and significantly improved outcomes of patients with advanced malignant melanoma. Local peripheral treatments (LPT), such as radiotherapy or electrochemotherapy, have been shown to modulate systemic immune responses, and preliminary data have raised the hypothesis that the combination of LPT with systemic immune checkpoint blockade might be beneficial. Clinical data from 127 consecutively treated melanoma patients at four cancer centers in Germany and Switzerland were analyzed. Patients received either ipilimumab (n = 82) or ipilimumab and additional LPT (n = 45) if indicated for local tumor control. The addition of LPT to ipilimumab significantly prolonged overall survival (OS; median OS 93 vs. 42 weeks, unadjusted HR, 0.46; P = 0.0028). Adverse immune-related events were not increased by the combination treatment, and LPT-induced local toxicities were in most cases mild. In a multivariable Cox regression analysis, we show that the effect of added LPT on OS remained statistically significant after adjusting for BRAF status, tumor stage, tumor burden, and central nervous system metastases (adjusted HR, 0.56; 95% confidence interval, 0.31-1.01, P = 0.05). Our data suggest that the addition of LPT to ipilimumab is safe and effective in patients with metastatic melanoma irrespective of clinical disease characteristics and known risk factors. Induction of antitumor immune responses is most likely the underlying mechanism and warrants prospective validation. Cancer Immunol Res; 4(9); 744-54. (c)2016 AACR.	3b
28678380	On the Iatrogenic Risk of Assessing Suicidality: A Meta-Analysis.	Previous studies have failed to detect an iatrogenic effect of assessing suicidality. However, the perception that asking about suicide may induce suicidality persists. This meta-analysis quantitatively synthesized research concerning the iatrogenic risks of assessing suicidality. This review included studies that explicitly evaluated the iatrogenic effects of assessing suicidality via prospective research methods. Thirteen articles were identified that met inclusion criteria. Evaluation of the pooled effect of assessing suicidality with regard to negative outcomes did not demonstrate significant iatrogenic effects. Our findings support the appropriateness of universal screening for suicidality, and should allay fears that assessing suicidality is harmful.	1a
22024859	Demographics and treatment trends in sinonasal mucosal melanoma.	OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: To evaluate the population characteristics of mucosal melanoma of the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses and determine the impact of the new staging classification. STUDY DESIGN: Analysis of a national database. METHODS: Patients were identified from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results tumor registry data with mucosal melanoma of the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses between 2000 and 2007. Tumors were classified using the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) 6th edition site-specific staging as well as 7th edition staging for head and neck mucosal melanoma (HNMM). Incidence rates and descriptive statistics were calculated, and multivariate analysis was performed to examine the impact of demographic factors and staging on survival. RESULTS: A total of 304 patients were identified. The incidence rate was 0.05 per 100,000. Fifty-six percent were female, 92% were >50 years old, and more than 90% were Caucasian; 81.6% of patients were treated with surgery, and 38.5% of patients received postoperative radiation. Overall, the 5-year survival rate was 24.2%. Significant differences in survival were observed for surgery with radiation (P = .005) and surgery alone (P = .04) compared with radiation alone. TNM staging using the AJCC 6th and 7th edition classification schemes yielded similar survival curves. However, the new classification for HNMM allows for better delineation of stage IV disease, revealing slightly improved survival for stage IVA disease. CONCLUSIONS: HNMM is a rare disease with a poor prognosis. Surgery remains the treatment of choice, with some role for adjuvant therapy. The new staging classification for HNMM appears to more efficiently stage this disease. Demographics and therapeutic findings are discussed.	3a
12413670	Does prophylactic treatment with proteolytic enzymes reduce acute toxicity of adjuvant pelvic irradiation? Results of a double-blind randomized trial.	PURPOSE: Does prophylactic treatment with proteolytic enzymes reduce acute toxicity of adjuvant pelvic radiotherapy? MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fifty-six patients with an indication for adjuvant pelvic irradiation after curative surgery were double-blind randomized. All patients took 3 x 4 capsules study medication daily during radiotherapy. Twenty-eight patients in the enzyme group (EG) received capsules containing papain, trypsin and chymotrypsin, 28 in the placebo group (PG) received placebo capsules. All patients were irradiated with 5 x 1.8 Gy weekly to 50.4 Gy using four-field-box technique after CT-based planning. Primary objective was the grade of diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, fatigue and epitheliolysis during radiotherapy. Secondary objectives were the number of supportive medications and treatment interruptions due to acute toxicity. RESULTS: None/mild diarrhea: 43% EG, 64% PG. Moderate/severe diarrhea: 57% EG, 36% PG (P = 0.11). Mean duration: 11 days in EG, 10 days in PG. None/mild nausea: 93% EG, 93% PG. Moderate/severe nausea: 7% EG, 7% PG. None/mild vomiting: 100% EG, 97% PG. None/mild fatigue: 82% EG, 93% PG. Moderate/severe fatigue: 18% EG, 7% PG (P = 0.23). None/mild epitheliolysis: 75% EG, 93% PG. Moderate/severe epitheliolysis: 25% EG, 7% PG (P = 0.16). Treatment interruption (mean days): 2.44 in EG, 1.46 in PG. Number of supportive medication: 29 in EG, 19 in PG. CONCLUSIONS: The prophylactic use of proteolytic enzymes does not reduce acute toxicities, treatment interruptions and number of supportive medication and therefore does not improve tolerance of adjuvant pelvic radiotherapy.	2b
25388059	Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in Thick-Melanoma Patients (N=350): What is Its Prognostic Role?	BACKGROUND: Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is currently recommended for patients with intermediate-thickness melanomas (T2-T3). Historically, T4 melanoma patients have not been considered good candidates for SLNB because of the high risk of distant progression. However, some authors suggest that T4 melanoma patients could be considered as a heterogeneous group that could benefit from SLNB. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 350 patients with thick (>4 mm) melanomas between 1999 and 2011. Patients were stratified into three groups depending on the results of SLNB: (1) 94 SLNB-negative; (2) 84 SLNB-positive; and (3) 172 SLNB not performed (observation group). The associations of clinical-pathologic features with the result of SLNB, disease-free interval (DFI), and disease-specific survival (DSS) were analyzed. RESULTS: Multivariate analyses confirmed a better prognosis for SLN-negative patients compared with patients in the observation group (DSS hazard ratio [HR] 0.62, p = 0.03; DFI HR 0.47, p < 0.001). The observation group was shown to have the same prognosis as the positive-sentinel lymph node group, when adjusted for principal confounders in the model. CONCLUSIONS: We confirmed that thick-melanoma patients are a heterogeneous group with different prognosis. In our experience, SLNB allowed for an appropriate stratification of patients in different survival groups. On the basis of our results, we strongly recommend the routine execution of SLNB in cases of primary melanoma thicker than 4 mm.	3a
17667021	Efficacy of pursed-lips breathing: a breathing pattern retraining strategy for dyspnea reduction.	PURPOSE: Breathing pattern retraining is frequently used for exertional dyspnea relief in adults with moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. However, there is contradictory evidence to support its use. The study objective was to compare 2 programs of prolonging expiratory time (pursed-lips breathing and expiratory muscle training) on dyspnea and functional performance. METHODS: A randomized, controlled design was used for the pilot study. Subjects recruited from the outpatient pulmonary clinic of a university-affiliated Veteran Affairs healthcare center were randomized to: 1) pursed-lips breathing, 2) expiratory muscle training, or 3) control. Changes over time in dyspnea [modified Borg after 6-minute walk distance (6MWD) and Shortness of Breath Questionnaire] and functional performance (Human Activity Profile and physical function scale of Short Form 36-item Health Survey) were assessed with a multilevel modeling procedure. Weekly laboratory visits for training were accompanied by structured verbal, written, and audiovisual instruction. RESULTS: Forty subjects with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [age = 65 +/- 9 (mean +/- standard deviation) years, forced expiratory volume 1 second/forced vital capacity % = 46 +/- 10, forced expiratory volume 1 second % predicted = 39 +/- 13, body mass index = 26 +/- 6 kg/m, inspiratory muscle strength = 69 +/- 22 cm H2O, and expiratory muscle strength (PEmax) = 102 +/- 29 cm H2O] were enrolled. No significant Group x Time difference was present for PEmax (P = .93). Significant reductions for the modified Borg scale after 6MWD (P = .05) and physical function (P = .02) from baseline to 12 weeks were only present for pursed-lips breathing. CONCLUSION: Pursed-lips breathing provided sustained improvement in exertional dyspnea and physical function.	1b
23369942	Outcomes following percutaneous upper gastrointestinal decompressive tube placement for malignant bowel obstruction in ovarian cancer.	OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate peri-operative and survival outcomes of ovarian cancer patients undergoing percutaneous upper gastrointestinal decompression for malignant bowel obstruction (MBO). METHODS: Retrospective chart review was used to identify patients with ovarian, peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer who underwent palliative decompressive treatment for MBO from 1/2002 to 12/2010. Kaplan-Meier methods were used to estimate the median survival (MS) and multivariate analysis used to determine if any variables were associated with the hazard of death. RESULTS: Fifty-three patients met inclusion criteria. Median length of diagnosis prior to intervention was 21 months. Fifteen (28.3%) patients experienced complications and 9 required revision. Forty-nine (92.5%) experienced relief of symptoms after placement, and 91% tolerated some form of oral intake. Following placement, 19 (36%) patients received additional chemotherapy and 21(41%) patients received total parental nutrition (TPN). Thirty-five patients were discharged home/outpatient facility, 16 to hospice care, and 2 died prior to discharge. MS for all patients was 46 days. Patients who received chemotherapy had a MS of 169 days compared to 33 days (p<0.001). We failed to find an association between survival and TPN or performance status. CONCLUSIONS: Malignant bowel obstruction is a common complication of ovarian cancer. Management is palliative; risks and benefits of any therapy must be considered. Percutaneous decompressive therapy provides relief from associated symptoms, and allows patients to be discharged home. Median survival in this group is limited, and decisions regarding aggressive therapy should be individualized.	3a
17126263	Melanoma of thumb: retrospective study for amputation levels, surgical margin and reconstruction.	For the treatment of melanoma of thumb, the evidence about amputation level (IP joint or MP joint) and cutaneous excision margin has not been fully presented. And reconstructions for lost thumbs need to be balanced against functional and aesthetic requirements of individual patients and overall prognosis. We report 15 patients, who underwent primary excision and reconstruction for thumb melanoma between 1986 and 2004 at Department of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, University of Hokkaido at Sapporo, Graduate School of Medicine. The patients were reviewed to evaluate the prognostic significance of variables including age and sex of the patient, tumour thickness, staging, level of amputation, and cutaneous excision margin. Our 15 cases were divided into two groups according to amputation level (MP or IP) and cutaneous excision margin (<40 mm or >or =40 mm) and prognosis was analysed statistically. The stage and thickness were identified as prognostic factors for disease-free survival; however, IP amputation and 10-30 mm margin did not compromise disease-free survival. Amputated thumb was reconstructed by pollicization, free toe to thumb transfer, reverse forearm flap, local flap, and skin graft. No major complication of reconstructed thumb occurred. Seven of eight cases of MP amputation were reconstructed by pollicization. On the other hand, five cases of IP amputation were reconstructed by volar skin flap in two cases, reverse forearm flap in two cases, and trimmed first toe transfer in one case. Although a small number of cases, our study is the first attempt focussing on melanoma of thumb, and evaluating amputation level and cutaneous margin separately. The reconstructive algorithm for the amputated thumb is proposed and has various tools including free toe to thumb transfer.	3b
26849799	Vitamin E neuroprotection against cisplatin ototoxicity: Preliminary results from a randomized, placebo-controlled trial.	BACKGROUND: Few studies have investigated the effect of vitamin E in reducing the cisplatin (CDDP)-induced ototoxicity. This study evaluated vitamin E supplementation as a protecting agent against CDDP-induced ototoxicity. METHODS: Patients who started CDDP were randomly assigned to receive vitamin E supplementation at 400 mg per day (group 1) or placebo (group 2). Audiograms and evoked brainstem responses were obtained at baseline, and after 1, 2, and 3 months. RESULTS: Twenty-three patients affected by solid malignancies were enrolled (13 in group 1 and 10 in group 2). At 1 month, a significant hearing loss in group 2 at both 2000 HZ (right ear: p = .05; left ear: p = .04) and 8000 HZ (right ear: p = .04; left ear: p = .03) was detected when compared to baseline values. Audiograms did not show significant changes. At 1 month, evoked brainstem responses remained unchanged in both arms without significant differences between groups. CONCLUSION: These preliminary findings confirm the neuroprotective properties of vitamin E against the CDDP-induced ototoxicity. (c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Head Neck 38: E2118-E2121, 2016.	2b
23516541	RASopathic skin eruptions during vemurafenib therapy.	PURPOSE: Vemurafenib is a potent inhibitor of V600 mutant BRAF with significant impact on progression-free and overall survival in advanced melanoma. Cutaneous side effects are frequent. This single-center observational study investigates clinical and histological features of these class-specific cutaneous adverse reactions. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were all treated with Vemurafenib 960 mg b.i.d. within local ethic committees approved clinical trials. All skin reactions were collected and documented prospectively. Cutaneous reactions were classified by reaction pattern as phototoxic and inflammatory, hair and nail changes, keratinocytic proliferations and melanocytic disorders. RESULTS: Vemurafenib was well tolerated, only in two patients the dose had to be reduced to 720 mg due to arthralgia. 26/28 patients (93%) experienced cutaneous side effects. Observed side effects included UVA dependent photosensitivity (n = 16), maculopapular exanthema (n = 14), pruritus (n = 8), folliculitis (n = 5), burning feet (n = 3), hair thinning (mild alopecia) (n = 8), curly hair (n = 2) and nail changes (n = 2). Keratosis pilaris and acanthopapilloma were common skin reactions (n = 12/n = 13), as well as plantar hyperkeratosis (n = 4), keratoacanthoma (n = 5) and invasive squamous cell carcinoma (n = 4). One patient developed a second primary melanoma after more than 4 months of therapy (BRAF and RAS wild type). CONCLUSION: Vemurafenib has a broad and peculiar cutaneous side effect profile involving epidermis and adnexa overlapping with the cutaneous manifestations of genetic diseases characterized by activating germ line mutations of RAS (RASopathy). They must be distinguished from allergic drug reaction. Regular skin examination and management by experienced dermatologists as well as continuous prophylactic photo protection including an UVA optimized sun screen is mandatory.	3b
31150123	Universal endometrial cancer tumor typing: How much has immunohistochemistry, microsatellite instability, and MLH1 methylation improved the diagnosis of Lynch syndrome across the population?	BACKGROUND: Universal tumor testing for defective DNA mismatch repair (MMR) is recommended for all women diagnosed with endometrial cancer to identify those with underlying Lynch syndrome. However, the effectiveness of these screening methods in identifying individuals with Lynch syndrome across the population has not been well studied. The aim of this study was to evaluate outcomes of MMR immunohistochemistry (IHC), mutL homolog 1 (MLH1) methylation, and microsatellite instability (MSI) analysis among patients with endometrial cancer. METHODS: A complete systematic search of online databases (PubMed, EMBASE, MEDLINE, and the Cochrane Library) for 1990-2018 was performed. A DerSimonian-Laird random effects model meta-analysis was used to estimate the weighted prevalence of Lynch syndrome diagnoses. RESULTS: The comprehensive search produced 4400 publications. Twenty-nine peer-reviewed studies met the inclusion criteria. Patients with endometrial cancer (n = 6649) were identified, and 206 (3%) were confirmed to have Lynch syndrome through germline genetic testing after positive universal tumor molecular screening. Among 5917 patients who underwent tumor IHC, 28% had abnormal staining. Among 3140 patients who underwent MSI analysis, 31% had MSI. Among patients with endometrial cancer, the weighted prevalence of Lynch syndrome germline mutations was 15% (95% confidence interval [CI], 11%-18%) with deficient IHC staining and 19% (95% CI, 13%-26%) with a positive MSI analysis. Among 1159 patients who exhibited a loss of MLH1 staining, 143 (13.7%) were found to be MLH1 methylation-negative among those who underwent methylation testing, and 32 demonstrated a germline MLH1 mutation (2.8% of all absent MLH1 staining cases and 22.4% of all MLH1 methylation-negative cases). Forty-three percent of patients with endometrial cancer who were diagnosed with Lynch syndrome via tumor typing would have been missed by family history-based screening alone. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the widespread implementation of universal tumor testing in endometrial cancer, data regarding testing results remain limited. This study provides predictive values that will help practitioners to evaluate abnormal results in the context of Lynch syndrome and aid them in patient counseling.	2a
24228247	The treatment outcome and radiation-induced toxicity for patients with head and neck carcinoma in the IMRT era: a systematic review with dosimetric and clinical parameters.	A descriptive analysis was made in terms of the related radiation induced acute and late mucositis and xerostomia along with survival and tumor control rates (significance level at 0.016, bonferroni correction), for irradiation in head and neck carcinomas with either 2D Radiation Therapy (2DRT) and 3D conformal (3DCRT) or Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT). The mean score of grade > II xerostomia for IMRT versus 2-3D RT was 0.31 +/- 0.23 and 0.56 +/- 0.23, respectively (Mann Whitney, P < 0.001). The parotid-dose for IMRT versus 2-3D RT was 29.56 +/- 5.45 and 50.73 +/- 6.79, respectively (Mann Whitney, P = 0.016). The reported mean parotid-gland doses were significantly correlated with late xerostomia (spearman test, rho = 0.5013, P < 0.001). A trend was noted for the superiority of IMRT concerning the acute oral mucositis. The 3-year overall survival for either IMRT or 2-3DRT was 89.5% and 82.7%, respectively (P = 0.026, Kruskal-Wallis test). The mean 3-year locoregional control rate was 83.6% (range: 70-97%) and 74.4 (range: 61-82%), respectively (P = 0.025, Kruskal-Wallis). In conclusion, no significant differences in terms of locoregional control, overall survival and acute mucositis could be noted, while late xerostomia is definitely higher in 2-3D RT versus IMRT. Patients with head and neck carcinoma should be referred preferably to IMRT techniques.	2b
18020932	Molecular staging for patients with malignant melanoma.	Molecular staging of cancers hold the promise of being more accurate compared with routine histology, particularly with regard to determining regional-nodal status. With newer reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR)-based assays, sensitivities reported are as high as identifying one cancer cell in a background of a million normal cells. Although this sensitivity is 100-times what the human eye can differentiate under the microscope, the new challenge becomes determining the relevance of this low-volume disease in the regional basin, in particular, the sentinel lymph node (SLN). Patients with melanomas greater than 0.75 mm in tumor thickness participated in a research study that examined their SLNs with routine histology, immunhistochemical staining and a RT-PCR assay based on the tyrosinase probe. A total of 311 patients were involved in the study and patients whose SLN were negative from all three assays for metastatic disease had a good survival, with a 92% disease-free survival (DFS) and a 97% overall survival (OS) regardless of the tumor thickness or the ulceration status of the primary melanoma. Patients upstaged with the RT-PCR assay had a significantly decreased DFS and OS compared with patients who were SLN negative. Patients who had enough tumor burden in the SLN that allowed their metastatic disease to be identified with routine histology had a 48% recurrence rate at 5 years. A recently published meta-analysis confirmed that molecular staging of the SLN in melanoma contains important prognostic information. Micrometastatic disease missed by routine histology in the SLN in melanoma patients is clinically relevant disease. Molecular staging has the potential of providing a more accurate staging in the SLN, for prognostication and directing adjuvant therapies.	2b
16041463	Systematic review of specialist palliative day-care for adults with cancer.	GOAL OF WORK: To inform future practice, research and policy in specialist palliative day-care by systematically reviewing the evidence for how the structure and process of this form of care relate to outcomes for adults with cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Medical, nursing and social science computerized databases were searched up until December 2003 for studies of palliative day-care reporting information on service structure, care processes or outcomes including symptom control, quality of life, social and psychological support, and patient and relative satisfaction with care. Qualitative and quantitative studies were assessed for methodological quality and graded, and the findings synthesized into the review. MAIN RESULTS: Twelve observational studies were found that showed the difficulties of evaluating a service already operating and of recruiting a vulnerable population of patients as they deteriorated. Most services are nurse-led, but varied in the facilities, staff mix, care models, activities and places they offered. Patients attending seemed a selected group of those already receiving palliative care who were mostly white, aged over 60 years and retired, with needs for emotional and social support and pain control. There were insufficient studies to provide conclusive evidence of improved symptom control or health-related quality of life, but all qualitative studies found patients valued the social support and opportunity to take part in activities that day-care provided. CONCLUSIONS: There is evidence for high satisfaction among patients selected into day-care, but not yet sufficient to judge whether this improves symptom control or health-related quality of life. Further research should explore selection and access into care, the most effective models of care, its cost, and potential benefits for relatives and carers. Comparison with models of care for older adults and those with mental illness would also be informative.	2a
23532835	Existential behavioural therapy for informal caregivers of palliative patients: a randomised controlled trial.	BACKGROUND: Existential behavioural therapy (EBT) was developed to support informal caregivers of palliative patients in the last stage of life and during bereavement as a manualised group psychotherapy comprising six sessions. We tested the effectiveness of EBT on mental stress and quality of life (QOL). METHODS: Informal caregivers were randomly assigned (1:1) to EBT or a treatment-as-usual control group using computer-generated numbers in blocks of 10. Primary outcomes were assessed with the Brief Symptom Inventory (subscales somatisation, anxiety and depression), the Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS), the WHOQOL-BREF and a numeric rating scale for QOL (QOL-NRS, range 0-10). Data were collected at baseline, pre-treatment, post-treatment and follow-ups after 3 and 12 months. Treatment effects were assessed with a multivariate analysis of covariance. RESULTS: Out of 160 relatives, 81 were assigned to EBT and 79 to the control group. Participants were 54.5 +/- 13.2 years old; 69.9% were female. The multivariate model was significant for the pre-/post-comparison (p=0.005) and the pre-/12-month comparison (p=0.05) but not for the pre-/3-month comparison. Medium to large effects on anxiety and QOL (SWLS, WHOQOL-BREF, QOL-NRS) were found at post-treatment; medium effects on depression and QOL (QOL-NRS) emerged in the 12-month follow-up. No adverse effects of the intervention were observed. CONCLUSION: Existential behavioural therapy appears to exert beneficial effects on distress and QOL of informal caregivers of palliative patients. Further longitudinal evidence is needed to confirm these findings.	1a
15166319	Prostate cancer: detection of extracapsular extension by genitourinary and general body radiologists at MR imaging.	PURPOSE: To determine whether predictive value of endorectal magnetic resonance (MR) imaging findings in detection of prostate cancer extracapsular extension (ECE) is significantly affected by the reader's subspecialty experience. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this cohort study, 344 consecutive patients with biopsy-proved prostate cancer underwent endorectal MR imaging followed by surgery. Likelihood of ECE described in MR imaging reports was compared with clinical predictor variables. ECE was determined from the final pathologic report on specimens resected at surgery. Readers of MR images were classified into genitourinary MR imaging radiologists (n = 4) and general body MR imaging radiologists (n = 6). For data analysis, Wilcoxon rank sum and chi(2) tests, as well as receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses, were used. A difference with P <.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: Univariate analysis results demonstrated that all predictors except clinical stage were significantly associated with detection of ECE in both groups of readers (P <.05). In the genitourinary MR imaging radiologist group of patients, area under the ROC curve for endorectal MR imaging findings (0.833) was larger than areas under the curves for all other predictors (0.566-0.701). In the general body MR imaging radiologist group of patients, area under the ROC curve for endorectal MR imaging findings (0.646) was not larger than areas under the curves for all other predictors (0.582-0.793). Results of multivariate analysis of two models, one with all predictors and another with all predictors except endorectal MR imaging findings, demonstrated a significant increase in area under the ROC curve with endorectal MR images interpreted by genitourinary MR imaging radiologists (P =.019 and.31, respectively). CONCLUSION: Endorectal MR imaging findings are significant predictors for detection of ECE when MR images are interpreted by genitourinary radiologists experienced with MR imaging of the prostate.	2a
6781297	Staging of carcinoma of the larynx: comparative accuracy of ct and laryngography.	The accuracy and clinical usefulness of both computed tomography (CT) and laryngography were evaluated in 30 patients with carcinoma of the larynx. The radiologic results were correlated with the surgical and pathologic findings. The accuracy in determining tumor compartmental localization (supraglottic, glottic, or subglottic) was as follows: CT provided the correct diagnosis in 26 cases. There were three false negative and one false positive diagnoses. Laryngography provided the correct diagnosis in 19 cases. There were six false negative and six false positive diagnoses. In virtually all cases, CT provided information equivalent to or more accurate than laryngography. CT is recommended as the radiologic procedure of choice when additional diagnostic information is required to supplement the findings of laryngoscopy in determining the feasibility of conservation surgery.	4
9263281	Glutamine supplementation in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy: a double-blind randomized study.	The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of glutamine in preventing doxifluridine-induced diarrhea and the potential impact of glutamine on the tumor growth. We investigated 65 patients with advanced breast cancer receiving doxifluridine in a double-blind randomized fashion: 33 patients took glutamine (30 g/d, divided in 3 doses of 10 g each) for 8 consecutive days (5-12h) during each interval between chemotherapy, which was administered from day 1 to 4. Thirty-two patients took an equal dose of placebo (maltodextrine). The incidence of diarrhea was registered after each cycle of chemotherapy and severity was scored by the National Cancer Institute (NCI), Bethesda, Maryland, classification. The tumor response was evaluated by the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria. A total of 278 and 259 cycles (median 10 cycles), respectively, were delivered in glutamine and placebo groups. There were 34 and 32 episodes of diarrhea in glutamine and placebo groups, with no statistical difference overall, in the severity and duration of tumor growth, there was no difference in the response rate (21% and 28% of complete or partial response, respectively), in median time to response (2 mo), or in median duration of response. In conclusion, glutamine did not prevent the occurrence of the doxifluridine-induced diarrhea and did not have any impact on tumor response to chemotherapy.	2b
16700035	Treatment options in lymph node-positive prostate cancer.	With improved awareness and screening, the incidence of lymph node-positive prostate cancer has declined dramatically over the last 50 years. Stage of cancer, prostate-specific antigen, and grade are risk factors for positive lymph nodes; and those factors, along with the number of involved lymph nodes, are prognostic factors for outcome. Although the numbers have declined, the number of men with lymph node-positive prostate cancer remains significant, and the current challenge is how best to treat these patients. Commonly used treatments include any combination of androgen ablation, surgery, and radiation. There have been a few studies with chemotherapy, and no treatment has been proven superior to the others. Consequently, there remain several reasonable alternatives to treatment, and long-term survival is not unusual.	1a
11413532	Efficacy of ultrasound B-scan compared with physical examination in follow-up of melanoma patients.	BACKGROUND: The value of ultrasound B-scan for routine follow-up of melanoma patients still is not generally accepted. Therefore, the authors compared the efficacy of physical examination (PE) with ultrasound B-scan (UBS) for detection of regional tumor recurrence in melanoma patients. The aim of the current study was to evaluate whether early detection of metastases improves relapse-free and overall survival. METHODS: For a period of 4 years, 829 consecutive melanoma patients were followed prospectively. Physical examination of 3011 patients and concomitant UBS of in-transit routes and regional lymph node basins were performed. Suspicious lesions were diagnosed by fine-needle aspiration cytology and pathology. RESULTS: During the study period, 242 (90.6%) of 267 patients with melanoma recurrences were first recognized by PE or UBS within the routine follow-up program. The sensitivities of both methods differed significantly (P = 0.001). Metastases were detected by PE in only 61 of 242 recurrences (25.2%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 19.9-31.2%), whereas UBS revealed 240 recurrences (99.2%, 95% CI: 97.3-99.6%). The specificity was 98.4% (95% CI: 97.8-98.8%) and 98.3% (95% CI: 97.7-98.7%), respectively. Survival of 103 patients who presented with a first nodal melanoma recurrence was followed and analyzed by multiple Cox regression. Overall survival was affected by the diameter of the largest metastasis (P = 0.001) and the number of metastatic lesions (P = 0.012). CONCLUSION: The study found that ultrasound B-scan was highly effective in the early detection of regional melanoma metastases compared with physical examination. Earlier detection of such metastases seemed to result in improved overall survival.	1b
19675868	Iotandium-111 pentetreotide scintigraphy and CT scans after 3 years in the follow-up of patients with malignant melanoma.	Somatostatin receptor scintigraphy (SRS) has been used for the detection of neuroendocrine tumors. Melanoma is a malignant tumor of melanocytes, considered to derive from the neural crest. As the prognosis of melanoma is very poor, early detection of the disease, of recurrences and of distal metastases, is important. The aim of our study was to evaluate the clinical impact of indium-111-diaethyleno triamino pentaacetic acid-d-phe1-octreotide ((111)In-DTPA-octreotide or octreoscan or (111)In-O) in the management of melanoma patients after first diagnosis and first surgery and during three years of follow-up. We have studied 35 patients 20 female and 15 male, with histological proven melanoma. Scintigraphic images with single photon emission tomography gamma-camera (Millenium GE-USA) were performed after the administration of 220MBq (111)In-O. The scintigraphic data were compared to axial computerized tomography (CT). Patients were followed for 3 years after the initial diagnosis and surgery. Our results showed that during the 3 years follow-up period, 26/35 patients had a clinical recurrence. Twenty of them had positive (111)In-O scans with 56 lesions mainly metastatic, while 6 had negative scans. The CT scans showed only 31/56 lesions. In conclusion, SRS with (111)In-O, for diagnosing metastases from malignant melanoma, showed a sensitivity and specificity of 87% and 94% respectively and within the 3 years of follow-up, the stage of melanoma and surgical strategies were modified by 48% and 32%, respectively. Twenty five tumor sites, unsuspected by CT were visualized by (111)In-O.	4
16841333	Antioxidant vitamins supplementation and mortality: a randomized trial in head and neck cancer patients.	There has been concern that long-term supplementation with high-dose antioxidant vitamins, especially vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol), may increase all-cause mortality. We conducted a randomized controlled trial with alpha-tocopherol (400 IU/day) and beta-carotene (30 mg/day) supplements among 540 head and neck cancer patients treated by radiation therapy. Supplementation with beta-carotene was discontinued during the trial. The supplements were given during radiation therapy and for 3 additional years. During the follow-up (median 6.5 years), 179 deaths were recorded. All death certificates were obtained. All-cause and cause-specific mortality rates were compared between the 2 arms of the trial by Cox regression. All-cause mortality was significantly increased in the supplement arm: hazard ratio: 1.38, 95% confidence interval 1.03-1.85. Cause-specific mortality rates tended to be higher in the supplement arm than in the placebo arm. Our results concur with previous reports to suggest that high-dose vitamin E could be harmful.	2b
26563265	In vivo assessment of optical properties of melanocytic skin lesions and differentiation of melanoma from non-malignant lesions by high-definition optical coherence tomography.	One of the most challenging problems in clinical dermatology is the early detection of melanoma. Reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) is an added tool to dermoscopy improving considerably diagnostic accuracy. However, diagnosis strongly depends on the experience of physicians. High-definition optical coherence tomography (HD-OCT) appears to offer additional structural and cellular information on melanocytic lesions complementary to that of RCM. However, the diagnostic potential of HD-OCT seems to be not high enough for ruling out the diagnosis of melanoma if based on morphology analysis. The aim of this paper is first to quantify in vivo optical properties such as light attenuation in melanocytic lesions by HD-OCT. The second objective is to determine the best critical value of these optical properties for melanoma diagnosis. The technique of semi-log plot whereby an exponential function becomes a straight line has been implemented on HD-OCT signals coming from four successive skin layers (epidermis, upper papillary dermis, deeper papillary dermis and superficial reticular dermis). This permitted the HD-OCT in vivo measurement of skin entrance signal (SES), relative attenuation factor normalized for the skin entrance signal (micro raf1) and half value layer (z 1/2). The diagnostic accuracy of HD-OCT for melanoma detection based on the optical properties, micro raf1 , SES and z 1/2 was high (95.6, 82.2 and 88.9 %, respectively). High negative predictive values could be found for these optical properties (96.7, 89.3 and 96.3 %, respectively) compared to morphologic assessment alone (89.9 %), reducing the risk of mistreating a malignant lesion to a more acceptable level (3.3 % instead of 11.1 %). HD-OCT seems to enable the combination of in vivo morphological analysis of cellular and 3-D micro-architectural structures with in vivo analysis of optical properties of tissue scatterers in melanocytic lesions. In vivo HD-OCT analysis of optical properties permits melanoma diagnosis with higher accuracy than in vivo HD-OCT analysis of morphology alone.	3b
20392515	A randomised trial of high vs low intensity training in breathing techniques for breathless patients with malignant lung disease: a feasibility study.	"BACKGROUND: Breathlessness remains a refractory symptom in malignant lung disease. Breathing training is an effective, non-pharmacological intervention but it is unclear how this should be delivered. This feasibility study aimed to assess recruitment and retention, best end point and variability of breathlessness scores in order to calculate sample size for a future study. METHOD: This was a single centre, randomised controlled non-blinded parallel group feasibility study. Eligible participants (breathless patients with intrathoracic malignancy) received three breathlessness management training sessions or a single session only. Follow-up was for eight weeks and endpoints were: numerical rating scales (NRS) of breathlessness severity; breathlessness distress; HADS questionnaire; coping (BriefCOPE and our NRS coping question); EQ-5D and EQ-VAS. RESULTS: 22 patients were randomised over 12 months; 55% of expected recruitment from pilot data. Screening logs indicated this resulted, in part, from excluding patients who were receiving or who had recently received chemotherapy or radiotherapy. There was 40% drop-out by week four. The most useful NRS scores for breathlessness severity were for ""worst"" and ""average"" over past 24h. From the variability data for ""worst breathlessness"", a sample size of 270 should allow detection of a 30% improvement in area under the curve in the three-session group compared with single-session, (90% power; p=0.05, two-tailed; 2:1 randomisation single:three sessions) allowing 50% drop out at four weeks. CONCLUSIONS: The follow-on study will test the hypothesis that three sessions of training improve breathlessness better than a single session. It will include patients undergoing palliative anti-cancer therapy. Stratification by centre will allow for differences in rates of chemotherapy or radiotherapy and variations in breathlessness service configuration."	1b
11526865	[Neoplastic invasion of laryngeal cartilage: diagnosis by computed tomography].	The diagnostic of the laryngeal cartilage neoplastic invasion plays an important role in the accurate staging of the laryngeal carcinoma and its treatment. To evaluate the accuracy of the CT diagnosing cartilage involvement, the present study is reported. 127 patients with carcinoma of the larynx and hipopharynx T3-T4, surgical treated between 1993 and 1997 at Ciudad Sanitaria y Universitaria de Bellvitge, are retrospectively studied. TC presents an a accuracy of 78%, a specificity of 91% and a sensitivity of 54% in the diagnostic of laryngeal cartilage invasion of the laryngeal and hipopharyngeal carcinoma.	4
23448356	Diagnostic accuracy of computed tomography findings for patients undergoing salvage total laryngectomy.	CONCLUSIONS: Computed tomography (CT) imaging has clear limitations for the diagnosis of cartilage invasion or tumor spread in recurrent laryngeal cancer. Alternative methods of pretreatment assessment are needed for recurrent laryngeal cancer. OBJECTIVES: The diagnosis and staging of recurrent laryngeal cancer, previously treated by radiation therapy (RT), remains challenging. Practically, surgeons need to depend on imaging to predict which patients will have a chance for conservation salvage laryngectomy. The purpose of the present study was to determine the accuracy of preoperative CT performed for recurrent laryngeal carcinoma evaluation following RT. METHODS: This retrospective review identified 32 patients who underwent salvage total laryngectomy after RT from 1998 to 2010. For our radiologic classification of the thyroid cartilage, we analyzed the conditions as normal, sclerosis, invasion, penetration, and extralaryngeal spread and categorized the state of the arytenoids and cricoid into three possible conditions: normal, sclerosis, and destruction. Radiographic findings were correlated with pathology findings. RESULTS: Sensitivity and specificity for the detection of the thyroid cartilage infiltration were 57% and 94%, 50% and 89% for the cricoid cartilage, and 33% and 76% for arytenoid cartilage, respectively. The accuracy of recurrent tumor classification was 59.4%. Three carcinomas were over-staged and 10 were under-staged.	4
15280341	Effect of a decision aid on knowledge and treatment decision making for breast cancer surgery: a randomized trial.	CONTEXT: The long-term results of randomized trials have demonstrated equivalent survival rates for mastectomy and breast-conserving therapy for the treatment of early stage breast cancer. Consequently, the choice of treatment should be based on a patient's preferences. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of a decision aid regarding the different surgical treatment options on patient decision making. DESIGN AND SETTING: A cluster randomized trial for which general surgeons in the communities of central-west, and eastern Ontario, Canada, were randomly assigned to use the decision aid or not in the surgical consultation. Patients received the decision aid or not based on the surgeon seen. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty surgeons participated in the study. Of the 208 eligible women with newly diagnosed clinical stage I or II breast cancer seen by study surgeons, 201 agreed to be evaluated: 94 were assigned to the decision board and 107 to usual practice. Patients were recruited from November 1999 to April 2002. INTERVENTION: The decision board is a decision aid designed to help physicians inform their patients about different treatment options and to enable patients to express a preference for treatment. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Patient knowledge about the surgical treatment of breast cancer; decisional conflict; satisfaction with decision making; and the treatment decision following the consultation. RESULTS: Patients in the decision board group had higher knowledge scores about their treatment options (66.9 vs 58.7; P<.001), had less decisional conflict (1.40 vs 1.62, P =.02), and were more satisfied with decision making (4.50 vs 4.32, P =.05) following the consultation. Patients who used the decision board were more likely to choose BCT (94% vs 76%, P =.03). CONCLUSIONS: The decision board was helpful in improving communication and enabling women to make a choice regarding treatment. Such instruments should be considered by surgeons when communicating the different surgical options to women with breast cancer.	1b
19167731	Adjuvant radiotherapy for pathological T3N0M0 prostate cancer significantly reduces risk of metastases and improves survival: long-term followup of a randomized clinical trial.	PURPOSE: Extraprostatic disease will be manifest in a third of men after radical prostatectomy. We present the long-term followup of a randomized clinical trial of radiotherapy to reduce the risk of subsequent metastatic disease and death. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 431 men with pT3N0M0 prostate cancer were randomized to 60 to 64 Gy adjuvant radiotherapy or observation. The primary study end point was metastasis-free survival. RESULTS: Of 425 eligible men 211 were randomized to observation and 214 to adjuvant radiation. Of those men under observation 70 ultimately received radiotherapy. Metastasis-free survival was significantly greater with radiotherapy (93 of 214 events on the radiotherapy arm vs 114 of 211 events on observation; HR 0.71; 95% CI 0.54, 0.94; p = 0.016). Survival improved significantly with adjuvant radiation (88 deaths of 214 on the radiotherapy arm vs 110 deaths of 211 on observation; HR 0.72; 95% CI 0.55, 0.96; p = 0.023). CONCLUSIONS: Adjuvant radiotherapy after radical prostatectomy for a man with pT3N0M0 prostate cancer significantly reduces the risk of metastasis and increases survival.	1a
21691817	Vitamin D and aromatase inhibitor-induced musculoskeletal symptoms (AIMSS): a phase II, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial.	A double-blind placebo-controlled randomized phase II trial was performed to determine whether High Dose Vitamin D2 supplementation (HDD) in women receiving adjuvant anastrozole improves aromatase inhibitor-induced musculoskeletal symptoms (AIMSS) and bone loss. Patients with early breast cancer and AIMSS were stratified according to their baseline 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25OHD) level. Stratum A (20-29 ng/ml) received either HDD 50,000 IU capsules weekly for 8 weeks then monthly for 4 months or placebo. Stratum B (10-19 ng/ml) received either HDD for 16 weeks and then monthly for 2 months, or placebo. AIMSS was assessed by the Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form (BPI-SF), the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ), and the Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI) at baseline, 2, 4, and 6 months. Bone Mineral Density (BMD) was measured at baseline and at 6 months. The primary endpoint of the study was the change-from-baseline musculoskeletal pain. The secondary endpoint was the percent change in BMD at 6 months. Sixty women were enrolled. Baseline characteristics were comparable between the groups. At 2 months, FIQ pain (P = 0.0045), BPI worst-pain (P = 0.04), BPI average-pain (P = 0.0067), BPI pain-severity (P = 0.04), and BPI interference (P = 0.034) scores were better in the HDD than placebo group. The positive effect of HDD on AIMSS was stronger across all time points in Stratum B than Stratum A (FIQ pain, P = 0.04; BPI average, P = 0.03; BPI severity, P = 0.03; BPI interference, P = 0.04). BMD at the femoral neck decreased in the placebo and did not change in the HDD group (P = 0.06). Weekly HDD improves AIMSS and may have a positive effect on bone health. Vitamin D supplementation strategies for breast cancer patients on AI should be further investigated.	2b
26515646	Real-time in vivo confocal laser scanning microscopy of melanin-containing cells: A promising diagnostic intervention.	The use of noninvasive imaging techniques to evaluate different types of skin lesions is increasing popular. In vivo confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) is a new method for high resolution non-invasive imaging of intact skin in situ and in vivo. Although many studies have investigated melanin-containing cells in lesions by in vivo CLSM, few studies have systematically characterized melanin-containing cells based on their morphology, size, arrangement, density, borders, and brightness. In this study, the characteristics of melanin-containing cells were further investigated by in vivo CLSM. A total of 130 lesions, including common nevi, giant congenital pigmented nevi, vitiligo, melasma, melanoma, and chronic eczema, were imaged by in vivo CLSM. This research helps dermatologists understand the characteristics of melanin-containing cells and facilitate the clinical application of melanin-containing cells in the investigation of dermatological disease. In summary, melanin-containing cells include keratinocytes, melanocytes, macrophages, and melanocytic skin tumor cells. Our study presents the CLSM characteristics of melanin-containing cells to potentially facilitate in vivo diagnosis based on shape, size, arrangement, density, borders, and brightness.	3a
11528187	Transrectal high intensity focused ultrasound for the treatment of localized prostate cancer: factors influencing the outcome.	OBJECTIVES: Efficacy evaluation of high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) treatment for localized prostate cancer and identification of the factors affecting the outcome. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 102 patients with prostate cancer stage T1-T2 and noncandidates for radical prostatectomy have been treated with HIFU (Ablatherm, EDAP-Technomed). The disease progression (failure) was strictly defined by any positive sample at control biopsies, whatever the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, or by 3 consecutive increases in PSA levels in case of negative biopsies. RESULTS: At inclusion, patients' baseline characteristics were (mean +/- standard deviation): age 70.8 (+/-6.13) years, PSA 8.38 (+/-4.8) ng/ml, prostate volume 33.3 (+/-16.71) cm3. The population mean follow-up was 19 months (3-76 months). The overall success rate was 66%. Statistically significant variations of the overall success with a more favorable outcome were observed when (1) the initial PSA level was < or =10 ng/ml (73 vs. 50%, p = 0.02), (2) the Gleason score was < or =6 (81 vs. 46%, p<0.001) and (3) the pretreatment sextant biopsy evidenced 1-4 positive samples (68 vs. 40%, p = 0.01). CONCLUSION: Results observed after HIFU treatment in localized prostate cancer are now challenging those obtained after radiation therapy. The success rate is influenced by disease-related prognostic factors.	3a
19815592	A randomized controlled trial of the effects of transcendental meditation on quality of life in older breast cancer patients.	UNLABELLED: This single-blind, randomized controlled trial evaluated the impact of the Transcendental Meditation program plus standard care as compared with standard care alone on the quality of life (QOL) of older women (>or=55 years) with stage II to IV breast cancer. One hundred and thirty women (mean age = 63.8) were randomly assigned to either experimental (n = 64) or control (n = 66) groups. Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast (FACT-B), Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy- Spiritual Well-Being (FACIT-SP), and Short-Form (SF)-36 mental health and vitality scales were administered every 6 months over an average 18-month intervention period. Significant improvements were found in the Transcendental Meditation group compared with controls in overall QOL, measured by the FACT-B total score (P = .037), emotional well-being (P = .046), and social well-being (P = .003) subscales, and SF-36 mental health ( P = .017). RESULTS: It is recommended that this stress reduction program, with its ease of implementation and home practice, be adopted in public health programs.	1b
27109574	Diagnostic accuracy of reflectance confocal microscopy for lesions typified by dermoscopic island.	INTRODUCTION: Dermoscopic island (DI) is a dermoscopic clue for the diagnosis of thin melanoma (MM). However, its positive predictive value is about 50% and several naevi with DI are unnecessarily excised. Reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) is a second level non-invasive imaging tool that increases diagnostic accuracy for MM. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate diagnostic RCM features of pigmented lesions typified by the presence of DI and calculate RCM diagnostic accuracy for MM diagnosis. METHODS: All lesions with DI were retrieved from a database of 1964 cases. RCM diagnoses were given without being aware of the histopathological diagnoses. The number of MMs among lesions presenting with DI and the sensitivity and specificity of RCM for MM were assessed. The frequencies of dermoscopic and RCM features were calculated to evaluate significant differences in naevi and MMs showing DI (Chi-square test). Independently significant RCM criteria for MM were identified by discriminant analysis. RESULTS: Sixty-three (3.2%) out of 1964 lesions presented DI. Among them, 30.2% were in situ MMs and 12.7% invasive MMs. Sensitivity and specificity of RCM for the diagnosis of MM in case of DI was 88.9%. Pagetoid cells (Wilks' lambda .804, P < 0.001) and atypical cells at dermo-epidermal junction (Wilks' lambda .762, P < 0.001) were identified to differentiate MM from naevi. CONCLUSION: Our study confirmed that DI could be a sign of early MMs and underlined that RCM could be a good tool to discriminate MMs and naevi in the presence of DI because it can identify the presence of cytological atypia.	3a
15718308	Hyperfractionated accelerated chemoradiation with concurrent fluorouracil-mitomycin is more effective than dose-escalated hyperfractionated accelerated radiation therapy alone in locally advanced head and neck cancer: final results of the radiotherapy cooperative clinical trials group of the German Cancer Society 95-06 Prospective Randomized Trial.	PURPOSE: To report the results and corresponding acute and late reactions of a prospective, randomized, clinical study in locally advanced head and neck cancer comparing concurrent fluorouracil (FU) and mitomycin (MMC) chemotherapy and hyperfractionated accelerated radiation therapy (C-HART; 70.6 Gy) to hyperfractionated accelerated radiation therapy alone (HART; 77.6 Gy). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Three hundred eighty-four stage III (6%) and IV (94%) oropharyngeal (59.4%), hypopharyngeal (32.3%), and oral cavity (8.3%) cancer patients were randomly assigned to receive either 30 Gy (2 Gy every day) followed by 1.4 Gy bid to a total of 70.6 Gy concurrently with FU (600 mg/m(2), 120 hours continuous infusion) days 1 through 5 and MMC (10 mg/m(2)) on days 5 and 36 (C-HART) or 14 Gy (2 Gy every day) followed by 1.4 Gy bid to a total dose of 77.6 Gy (HART). The data were analyzed on an intent-to-treat basis. RESULTS: At 5 years, the locoregional control and overall survival rates were 49.9% and 28.6% for C-HART versus 37.4% and 23.7% for HART, respectively (P = .001 and P = .023, respectively). Progression-free and freedom from metastases rates were 29.3% and 51.9% for C-HART versus 26.6% and 54.7% for HART, respectively (P = .009 and P = .575, respectively). For C-HART, maximum acute reactions of mucositis, moist desquamation, and erythema were lower than with HART, whereas no differences in late reactions and overall rates of secondary neoplasms were observed. CONCLUSION: C-HART (70.6 Gy) is superior to dose-escalated HART (77.6 Gy) with comparable or less acute reactions and equivalent late reactions, indicating an improvement of the therapeutic ratio.	1b
17453298	A randomized phase 2 trial of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in resectable pancreatic cancer: gemcitabine alone versus gemcitabine combined with cisplatin.	BACKGROUND: Survival after surgery for pancreas cancer remains low. This improves with adjuvant chemotherapy, but up to 30% patients do not receive the prescribed treatment. Neoadjuvant therapy may increase the proportion of patients who receive all treatment components, may downstage disease before surgery, and may provide early treatment of micrometastases. This randomized phase 2 study compares gemcitabine-based chemotherapy regimens to identify the most promising regimen for future study. METHODS: Fifty patients with potentially resectable pancreas lesions were enrolled onto the study. Twenty-four patients were randomized to gemcitabine (1000 mg/m(2)) every 7 days for 43 days; 26 patients were randomized to gemcitabine (1000 mg/m(2)) and cisplatin (25 mg/m(2)), 7 to the original schedule (omitting day 22) and 19 to a revised schedule due to neutropenia (omitting days 15 and 36). The primary outcome measure was resection rate. RESULTS: Patients who were allocated to gemcitabine received a median of 85% of the planned dose. Patients who were allocated to combination treatment received a median of 88% and 92% of the planned gemcitabine and cisplatin doses, respectively. There were 10 episodes of grade III/IV hematological toxicity in each group. Twenty-seven patients (54%) underwent pancreatic resection, 9 (38%) in the gemcitabine arm and 18 (70%) in the combination arm, with no increase in surgical complications. To date, 34 patients (68%) have died. Twelve-month survival for the gemcitabine and combination groups was 42% and 62%. CONCLUSIONS: Chemotherapy can be safely administered before pancreatic surgery. Combination therapy with gemcitabine and cisplatin is associated with a high resection rate and an encouraging survival rate, suggesting that further study is warranted.	2b
17105795	Adjuvant radiotherapy for pathologically advanced prostate cancer: a randomized clinical trial.	CONTEXT: Despite a stage-shift to earlier cancer stages and lower tumor volumes for prostate cancer, pathologically advanced disease is detected at radical prostatectomy in 38% to 52% of patients. However, the optimal management of these patients after radical prostatectomy is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether adjuvant radiotherapy improves metastasis-free survival in patients with stage pT3 N0 M0 prostate cancer. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Randomized, prospective, multi-institutional, US clinical trial with enrollment between August 15, 1988, and January 1, 1997 (with database frozen for statistical analysis on September 21, 2005). Patients were 425 men with pathologically advanced prostate cancer who had undergone radical prostatectomy. INTERVENTION: Men were randomly assigned to receive 60 to 64 Gy of external beam radiotherapy delivered to the prostatic fossa (n = 214) or usual care plus observation (n = 211). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome was metastasis-free survival, defined as time to first occurrence of metastatic disease or death due to any cause. Secondary outcomes included prostate-specific antigen (PSA) relapse, recurrence-free survival, overall survival, freedom from hormonal therapy, and postoperative complications. RESULTS: Among the 425 men, median follow-up was 10.6 years (interquartile range, 9.2-12.7 years). For metastasis-free survival, 76 (35.5%) of 214 men in the adjuvant radiotherapy group were diagnosed with metastatic disease or died (median metastasis-free estimate, 14.7 years), compared with 91 (43.1%) of 211 (median metastasis-free estimate, 13.2 years) of those in the observation group (hazard ratio [HR], 0.75; 95% CI, 0.55-1.02; P = .06). There were no significant between-group differences for overall survival (71 deaths, median survival of 14.7 years for radiotherapy vs 83 deaths, median survival of 13.8 years for observation; HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.58-1.09; P = .16). PSA relapse (median PSA relapse-free survival, 10.3 years for radiotherapy vs 3.1 years for observation; HR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.31-0.58; P<.001) and disease recurrence (median recurrence-free survival, 13.8 years for radiotherapy vs 9.9 years for observation; HR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.46-0.82; P = .001) were both significantly reduced with radiotherapy. Adverse effects were more common with radiotherapy vs observation (23.8% vs 11.9%), including rectal complications (3.3% vs 0%), urethral strictures (17.8% vs 9.5%), and total urinary incontinence (6.5% vs 2.8%). CONCLUSIONS: In men who had undergone radical prostatectomy for pathologically advanced prostate cancer, adjuvant radiotherapy resulted in significantly reduced risk of PSA relapse and disease recurrence, although the improvements in metastasis-free survival and overall survival were not statistically significant.

8477317	Hormonal treatment of obstructed kidneys in patients with prostatic cancer.	A review of 1288 patients with previously untreated prostatic cancer revealed 209 patients (16%) with ureteric obstruction; the obstruction was bilateral in 36%. The effect of hormonal treatment was assessed in 88 patients with 120 obstructed kidneys: 77 patients had androgen deprivation or hormonal medication alone and 11 patients needed percutaneous nephrostomy or ureteric catheters in addition. Drainage improved in 58% of the kidneys. The diverting catheter was withdrawn in 9 of the 11 patients after a median of 4 weeks. In all, 95% of patients were discharged. The patients with hormonal therapy alone survived for a median of 26 months (range 1-111), while the patients who also needed diversion survived for a median of 13 months (range 1-28). The median time spent at home was 24 months (0-102) and 10 months (0-23) respectively, presumably reflecting the worse general condition of the patients who required diversion.	2b
22663011	Improved survival with MEK inhibition in BRAF-mutated melanoma.	BACKGROUND: Activating mutations in serine-threonine protein kinase B-RAF (BRAF) are found in 50% of patients with advanced melanoma. Selective BRAF-inhibitor therapy improves survival, as compared with chemotherapy, but responses are often short-lived. In previous trials, MEK inhibition appeared to be promising in this population. METHODS: In this phase 3 open-label trial, we randomly assigned 322 patients who had metastatic melanoma with a V600E or V600K BRAF mutation to receive either trametinib, an oral selective MEK inhibitor, or chemotherapy in a 2:1 ratio. Patients received trametinib (2 mg orally) once daily or intravenous dacarbazine (1000 mg per square meter of body-surface area) or paclitaxel (175 mg per square meter) every 3 weeks. Patients in the chemotherapy group who had disease progression were permitted to cross over to receive trametinib. Progression-free survival was the primary end point, and overall survival was a secondary end point. RESULTS: Median progression-free survival was 4.8 months in the trametinib group and 1.5 months in the chemotherapy group (hazard ratio for disease progression or death in the trametinib group, 0.45; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.33 to 0.63; P<0.001). At 6 months, the rate of overall survival was 81% in the trametinib group and 67% in the chemotherapy group despite crossover (hazard ratio for death, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.32 to 0.92; P=0.01). Rash, diarrhea, and peripheral edema were the most common toxic effects in the trametinib group and were managed with dose interruption and dose reduction; asymptomatic and reversible reduction in the cardiac ejection fraction and ocular toxic effects occurred infrequently. Secondary skin neoplasms were not observed. CONCLUSIONS: Trametinib, as compared with chemotherapy, improved rates of progression-free and overall survival among patients who had metastatic melanoma with a BRAF V600E or V600K mutation.

16809733	Molecular load of pathologically occult metastases in pelvic lymph nodes is an independent prognostic marker of biochemical failure after localized prostate cancer treatment.	PURPOSE: Thirty percent of patients treated with curative intent for localized prostate cancer (PC) experience biochemical recurrence (BCR) with rising serum prostate-specific antigen (sPSA), and of these, approximately 50% succumb to progressive disease. More discriminatory staging procedures are needed to identify occult micrometastases that spawn BCR. PATIENTS AND METHODS: PSA mRNA copies in pathologically normal pelvic lymph nodes (N0-PLN) from 341 localized PC patients were quantified by real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Based on comparisons with normal lymph nodes and PLN with metastases and on normalization to 5 x 10(6) glyceraldehyde-3'-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA copies, normalized PSA copies (PSA-N) and a threshold of PSA-N 100 or more were selected for continuous and categorical multivariate analyses of biochemical failure-free survival (BFFS) compared with established risk factors. RESULTS: At median follow-up of 4 years, the BFFS of patients with PSA-N 100 or more versus PSA-N less than 100 was 55% and 77% (P = .0002), respectively. The effect was greatest for sPSA greater than 20 ng/mL, 25% versus 60% (P = .014), Gleason score 8 or higher, 21% versus 66% (P = .0002), stage T3c, 18% versus 64% (P = .001), and high-risk group (50% v 72%; P = .05). By continuous analysis PSA-N was an independent prognostic marker for BCR (P = .049) with a hazard ratio of 1.25 (95% CI, 1.001 to 1.57). By categorical analysis, PSA-N 100 or more was an independent variable (P = .021) with a relative risk of 1.98 (95% CI, 1.11 to 3.55) for BCR compared with PSA-N less than 100. CONCLUSION: PSA-N 100 or more is a new, independent molecular staging criterion for localized PC that identifies high-risk group patients with clinically relevant occult micrometastases in N0-PLN, who may benefit from additional therapy to prevent BCR.	2a
26463298	Adrenalectomy for Metastatic Melanoma: Current Role in the Age of Nonsurgical Treatments.	Surgical resection of metastases to the adrenal gland can improve overall survival of patients with stage IV melanoma, but its relative value with respect to current nonsurgical therapies is unknown. We hypothesized that surgery remains an optimal first-line treatment approach for resectable adrenal metastases. A search of our institution's prospectively collected melanoma database identified stage IV patients treated for adrenal metastases between January 1, 2000, and August 11, 2014. The 91 study patients had a mean age of 60.3 years at diagnosis of adrenal metastasis and 24 had undergone adrenalectomy. Improved survival was associated with an unknown primary lesion, surgical resection, and nonsurgical therapies. Median overall survival from diagnosis of adrenal metastases was 29.2 months with adrenalectomy versus 9.4 months with nonoperative treatment. Adrenalectomy, either as complete metastasectomy or targeted to lesions resistant to systemic therapy, is associated with improved long-term survival in metastatic melanoma.	3a
3311120	Effects of chronic administration of codeine and promethazine on breathlessness and exercise tolerance in patients with chronic airflow obstruction.	It has been reported that short-term treatment with relatively high doses of opiates or promethazine causes improvements in dyspnoea and exercise tolerance in patients with chronic airflow obstruction (CAO). This study was designed to determine whether initial benefits were sustained during chronic administration of codeine or promethazine and to compare the two drugs in terms of their efficacy and possible mechanisms of action. Eleven patients with stable CAO were entered into a double-blind, randomized cross-over trial in which codeine (30 mg four times daily) or promethazine (25 mg four times daily) were orally administered for 1-month periods. Treatment effects were assessed by spirometry, arterial blood gases, 12-minute walk distance and subjective dyspnoea ratings. A statistically significant increase from the baseline in mean arterial PCO2 at at 24 hours (P less than 0.01) and at 1 month (P less than 0.05) occurred with codeine administration. There was no significant change from baseline for any other measurement with either drug, and no differences were detected between the two treatment arms. Four of the eleven patients did not complete the study; three of the four experienced worsening of their CAO requiring hospitalization (two while receiving codeine, one while receiving promethazine). We conclude that chronic treatment with either codeine or promethazine provides uncertain benefits to patients with CAO which may not outweigh potential risks.	1b
26712903	Clinical outcomes of melanoma brain metastases treated with stereotactic radiation and anti-PD-1 therapy.	BACKGROUND: The anti-programmed death-1 (anti-PD-1) therapy nivolumab has significant clinical activity in patients with metastatic melanoma. However, little is known about the safety and outcomes in patients receiving anti-PD-1 therapy and stereotactic radiation for the treatment of brain metastases (BMs). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data were analyzed retrospectively from two prospective nivolumab protocols enrolling 160 patients with advanced resected and unresectable melanoma at a single institution. Patients were included if BMs were diagnosed and treated with stereotactic radiation within 6 months of receiving nivolumab. The primary end point of this study was neurotoxicity; secondary end points included BM control and survival. RESULTS: Twenty-six patients with a total of 73 BMs treated over 30 sessions were identified. Radiation was administered before, during and after nivolumab in 33 lesions (45%), 5 lesions (7%), and 35 lesions (48%), respectively. All BMs were treated with stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) in a single session except 12 BMs treated with fractionated stereotactic radiation therapy, nine of which were in the postoperative setting. One patient experienced grade 2 headaches following SRS with symptomatic relief with steroid treatment. No other treatment-related neurologic toxicities or scalp reactions were reported. Eight (11%) local BM failures with a >/=20% increase in volume were noted. Of these lesions, hemorrhage was noted in 4, and edema was noted in 7. Kaplan-Meier estimates for local BM control following radiation at 6 and 12 months were 91% and 85%, respectively. Median overall survival (OS) from the date of stereotactic radiation and nivolumab initiation was 11.8 and 12.0 months, respectively, in patients receiving nivolumab for unresected disease (median OS was not reached in patients treated in the resected setting). CONCLUSIONS: In our series, stereotactic radiation to melanoma BMs is well tolerated in patients who received nivolumab. BM control and OS appear prolonged compared with standard current treatment. Prospective evaluation is warranted.	3a
1737204	The effect of immediately preoperative adjuvant radiotherapy in the surgical treatment of primary cutaneous malignant melanoma.	A historical series of patients with primary cutaneous malignant melanoma is reviewed. These patients had been treated with a single therapeutic dose of irradiation to the tumour and surrounding skin immediately before surgical excision. Some patients had also received a single necrotising dose of radiotherapy to the tumour itself. Recurrence and survival rates have been examined retrospectively in the light of reviewed histology, and compared with other published series. Preoperative radiotherapy was found to have no significant influence on the outcome of surgical treatment of primary malignant melanoma.	4
24716922	Prevalence and age, gender and geographical area distribution of esophageal squamous cell carcinomas in North China from 1985 to 2006.	OBJECTIVE: To establish the prevalence and distribution profile of esophageal squamous cell carcinomas (ESCCs) over a 22-yr period in North China. METHODS: Using endoscopy for primary diagnosis and histological analysis for the further confirmation, a total of 74,854 ESCC patients aged 20-89 between January 1985 and December 2006 were investigated to analyze the epidemiological profile including prevalence rates, distribution of age-of-onset, gender and geographical area of ESCC in Luoyang, the highest incidence area of North China. RESULTS: A total of 4092 cases of ESCC were finally diagnosed among 74,854 patients who had their first endoscopies. The prevalence among males was higher than that among females (p<0.01), resulting in an overall male:female OR of 1.2 (95%CI, 1.2-1.3). The prevalence in rural areas was higher than in urban areas (p<0.01), resulting in an overall rural:urban OR of 2.6 (95%CI, 2.4-2.9). The rural:urban ORs and the 95% CI increased continuously from 2.6, 2.3-3.0 to 2.7, 2.2-3.3, respectively, for 4 consecutive periods during the 22-yr study period. Moreover, the median age of onset among females was higher than that among males (p<0.01). For both sexes and in both areas, the prevalence rates declined and the median age of onset rose for 4 consecutive periods in the 22-yrs time frame (p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: [corrected] These data reveal the epidemiological profile of ESCC in the area of North China, and suggest that urban areas and rural people account for a growing proportion of the ESCC patients although the prevalence of ESCC significantly declined and the median age-of-onset postponed over the 22-yrs period. Moreover, the prevalence status of ESCC in rural areas also underlines the need for public health initiatives aimed at reducing risk factors of this fatal disease.	2b
27903827	Effects of Auricular Acupressure on Constipation in Patients With Breast Cancer Receiving Chemotherapy: A Randomized Control Trial.	The purpose was to examine the effects of auricular acupressure to relieve constipation in patients with breast cancer who were undergoing chemotherapy. Participants were 52 patients with breast cancer receiving chemotherapy at E University Hospital, Seoul, Korea, randomized into two groups of equal size. For the experimental group, auricular acupressure was applied to seven auricular acupoints for 6 weeks using vaccaria seeds, whereas the control group received the usual care. Constipation-assessment scores of the experimental group were significantly lower compared with the control group ( p < .001). Stool-form scores of the experimental group were significantly higher compared with the control group ( p = .003). Patient Assessment of Constipation-Quality of Life scores of the experimental group were significantly lower compared with the control group ( p < .001). Auricular acupressure was effective at relieving constipation in patients with breast cancer receiving chemotherapy. Auricular acupressure was also a safe and acceptable nursing intervention.	2b
16490871	Early-stage glottic cancer: oncological results and margins in laser cordectomy.	OBJECTIVES: To assess local control of early-stage glottic cancer by laser cordectomy in comparison with previously published external partial laryngectomy series and to determine the relevance of histological margins in glottic cancers excised with laser cordectomy. DESIGN: Retrospective review of laser cordectomy for carcinoma in situ (Tis) and stage T1 glottic cancer from January 1991 to January 2004. SETTING: University hospital. PATIENTS: Fifty-two patients with Tis or T1 glottic cancer. INTERVENTION: Endoscopic laser cordectomy, classified using the system proposed by the European Laryngeal Society Working Committee. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Local control after initial surgery and after salvage compared with a published historical control group, according to the type of cordectomy performed and the histological margins of the removed specimen. RESULTS: Sixteen patients with Tis, 30 with T1a tumors, and 6 with T1b tumors were followed up for an average of 38 months. Type I cordectomy was the most common procedure used to treat Tis, and type II and type III were the most common for treating T1a and T1b tumors. Of 6 recurrences, 4 were treated with laser cordectomy and 2 were treated with external partial laryngectomy. The rate of laryngeal preservation was 100%. There were 3 recurrences despite histologically clear margins. Three (17%) of 18 patients with suspicious margins developed recurrences. The rate of local control with single intervention (46 [89%] of 52) was lower than with partial external laryngectomy. However, 46 (89%) of 52 patients ultimately had less tissue removed by laser than would have been removed by external partial laryngectomy. CONCLUSIONS: Laser cordectomy provides excellent local control and laryngeal preservation. Close follow-up of patients with positive or suspicious margins is an alternative to further routine treatment.	4
25550564	Prognostic significance of microscopic tumor burden in sentinel lymph node in patients with cutaneous melanoma.	BACKGROUND/AIM: Sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy provides useful prognostic information for patients with melanoma. The present study sought to determine the prognostic value of SLN tumor burden on overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). We also assessed its association with non-sentinel lympth node (NSLN) involvement. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of 138 patients with cutaneous melanoma, who were found to have positive SLNs from 2000 to 2011. SLN tumor burden was measured in the maximum diameter of the largest tumor focus. OS and DFS were assessed by the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazard regression model. A logistic regression model was used to evaluate the association between SLN tumor burden and NSLN positivity. RESULTS: On multivariable analysis, SLN tumor burden was significantly associated with OS (hazard ratio (HR)>1 vs. </= 1 mm=5.15; 95% confidence interval (CI)=2.32-11.44; p<0.0001) and DFS rate (HR>1 vs. </= 1 mm=3.02; 95% CI=1.37-6.67; p=0.0064). On univariate analysis, SLN tumor burden was significantly associated with NSLN positivity (OR>1 vs. </= 1 mm=3.41; 95% CI=1.03-11.27; p=0.04). CONCLUSION: SLN tumor burden, by measuring the maximum diameter of the largest tumor focus, is significantly associated with OS, DFS and NSLN involvement.	2b
23851020	Advanced imaging technologies increase detection of dysplasia and neoplasia in patients with Barrett's esophagus: a meta-analysis and systematic review.	BACKGROUND & AIMS: US guidelines recommend surveillance of patients with Barrett's esophagus (BE) to detect dysplasia. BE conventionally is monitored via white-light endoscopy (WLE) and a collection of random biopsy specimens. However, this approach does not definitively or consistently detect areas of dysplasia. Advanced imaging technologies can increase the detection of dysplasia and cancer. We investigated whether these imaging technologies can increase the diagnostic yield for the detection of neoplasia in patients with BE, compared with WLE and analysis of random biopsy specimens. METHODS: We performed a systematic review, using Medline and Embase, to identify relevant peer-review studies. Fourteen studies were included in the final analysis, with a total of 843 patients. Our metameter (estimate) of interest was the paired-risk difference (RD), defined as the difference in yield of the detection of dysplasia or cancer using advanced imaging vs WLE. The estimated paired-RD and 95% confidence interval (CI) were obtained using random-effects models. Heterogeneity was assessed by means of the Q statistic and the I(2) statistic. An exploratory meta-regression was performed to look for associations between the metameter and potential confounders or modifiers. RESULTS: Overall, advanced imaging techniques increased the diagnostic yield for detection of dysplasia or cancer by 34% (95% CI, 20%-56%; P < .0001). A subgroup analysis showed that virtual chromoendoscopy significantly increased the diagnostic yield (RD, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.14-0.56; P < .0001). The RD for chromoendoscopy was 0.35 (95% CI, 0.13-0.56; P = .0001). There was no significant difference between virtual chromoendoscopy and chromoendoscopy, based on Student t test analysis (P = .45). CONCLUSIONS: Based on a meta-analysis, advanced imaging techniques such as chromoendoscopy or virtual chromoendoscopy significantly increase the diagnostic yield for identification of dysplasia or cancer in patients with BE.	2a
19937477	Does the mechanism of lymph node invasion affect survival in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma?	"BACKGROUND: Lymph node metastases are prognostically significant in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Little is known about the significance of direct lymph node invasion. AIM: The aim of this study is to find out whether direct lymph node invasion has the same prognostic significance as regional nodal metastases. METHODS: Retrospective review of patients resected between 1/1/1993 and 7/31/2008. ""Direct"" was defined as tumor extension into adjacent nodes, and ""regional"" was defined as metastases to peripancreatic nodes. RESULTS: Overall, 517 patients underwent pancreatic resection for adenocarcinoma, of whom 89 had one positive node (direct 26, regional 63), and 79 had two positive nodes (direct 6, regional 68, both 5). Overall, survival of node-negative patients was improved compared to patients with positive nodes (N0 30.8 months vs. N1 16.4 months; p < 0.001). There was no survival difference for patients with direct vs. regional lymph node invasion (p = 0.67). Patients with one positive node had a better overall survival compared to patients with >/=2 positive nodes (22.3 and 15 months, respectively; p < 0.001). The lymph node ratio (+LN/total LN) was prognostically significant after Cox regression (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Isolated direct invasion occurs in 20% of patients with one to two positive nodes. Node involvement by metastasis or by direct invasion are equally significant predictors of reduced survival. Both the number of positive nodes and the lymph node ratio are significant prognostic factors."	2b
19561479	Survival after pancreaticoduodenectomy is not improved by extending resections to achieve negative margins.	"OBJECTIVE: This study was undertaken to determine the survival benefit of extending resections to obtain microscopically negative margins after positive intraoperative frozen sections. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: The impact of residual microscopic disease after pancreaticoduodenectomy is currently a point of controversy. It is, however, generally believed that microscopically positive margins negatively impact survival and this may be improved by ultimately achieving negative margins. METHODS: Since 1995, patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy for pancreatic adenocarcinoma have been prospectively followed. Margin status has been codified as macro/microscopically negative (R0) or macroscopically negative/microscopically positive (R1). The impact of margin status on survival was evaluated utilizing survival curve analysis. Data are presented as median, mean +/- SD where appropriate. RESULTS: For pancreatic adenocarcinoma, 202 patients underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy. R0 resections were achieved in 158 patients, 17 of whom required extended resections to achieve complete tumor extirpation after an initially positive intraoperative frozen section (R1 --> R0). R1 resections were undertaken in 44 patients. Median survival for patients undergoing R0 resections was 21 months, 26 +/- 23.4 months versus 13 months, 17 +/- 21.0 months for patients undergoing R1 resections (P = 0.02). Median survival for patients undergoing R1 --> R0 resections was 11 months, 16 +/- 17.3, (P = 0.001). Margin status had a significant correlation with ""N"" stage and AJCC stage but not ""T"" stage. CONCLUSION: Survival after pancreaticoduodenectomy is not improved by extending pancreatic resections to achieve negative margins after initially positive intraoperative frozen sections. Tumor-specific factors beyond the presence of disease at a surgical margin are responsible for the abbreviated survival seen in patients undergoing R1 resections."	4
12101195	Effects of complete androgen blockade for 12 and 24 weeks on the pathological stage and resection margin status of prostate cancer.	AIMS: To compare the pathological stage and surgical margin status in patients undergoing either immediate radical prostatectomy or 12 and 24 weeks of neoadjuvant hormonal treatment (NHT) in a prospective, randomised study. METHODS: Whole mount sections of 393 radical prostatectomy specimens were evaluated: 128 patients had immediate surgery, 143 were treated for 12 weeks and 122 for 24 weeks with complete androgen blockade. RESULTS: Histopathology revealed organ confined tumours in 40.4% of patients with clinical stage B disease in the immediate surgery group, whereas 12 and 24 weeks of NHT increased the number of organ confined tumours to 54.6% and 64.8%, respectively. Among patients with clinical stage C tumours, pathological staging found organ confined disease in 10.4%, 31.4%, and 61.2% in the immediate surgery, 12 weeks of NHT, and 24 weeks of NHT groups, respectively. Preoperative NHT caused a significant decrease in positive margins both in patients with clinical stage B and C disease. The extent of margin involvement was not influenced by preoperative treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Neoadjuvant androgenic suppression is effective in reducing both the pathological stage and the positive margin rate in patients with stage B and C prostatic cancer undergoing radical surgery. Some beneficial effects are evident in those patients treated for 24 weeks, and it is reasonable to assume that the optimal duration of NHT is longer than three months.	1a
17660068	Laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy: technique and outcomes.	BACKGROUND: We describe our experience with laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy, including 5-year actuarial survival rates. STUDY DESIGN: This is a retrospective study of selected patients who underwent laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy at a single center between 1998 and 2006. We have described the salient features of our technique and followup protocol. Patient characteristics, histologic variety of the tumor, resection margins, morbidity, mortality, and actuarial survival rates were studied. RESULTS: The procedure could be completed laparoscopically with tumor-free margins in all patients, including patients with ampullary carcinoma (n = 24), pancreatic cystadenocarcinoma (n = 4), pancreatic head adenocarcinoma (n = 9), low common bile duct cancer (n = 3), and two patients with chronic pancreatitis with a suspicious mass lesion in the head of pancreas. Mean age of patients was 61 years (range 28 to 70 years). There was a single perioperative mortality. Overall followup rate was 95.1%, with two patients lost to followup at 22 and 36 months. Among the survivors, two patients have metastatic disease and local recurrence developed in one patient. Five-year actuarial survival rates for all patients with malignancy, ampullary adenocarcinoma, pancreatic cystadenocarcinoma, pancreatic head adenocarcinoma, and common bile duct adenocarcinoma are 32%, 30.7%, 33.3%, 19.1%, and 50%, respectively. Presence of microscopic lymph node involvement is associated with poor survival, although operations in the setting of chronic pancreatitis resulted in increased morbidity. CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy can be performed with safety and good results in properly selected patients. Localized malignant lesions, irrespective of histopathology, are particularly amenable to this approach.	4
22771132	Olanzapine for the relief of nausea in patients with advanced cancer and incomplete bowel obstruction.	Bowel obstruction is one of the most common complications in patients with advanced cancer. Incomplete bowel obstruction is one of the leading causes of nausea and vomiting, which may result in a substantial impairment to quality of life. We explored the antiemetic activity of olanzapine against nausea and vomiting in cancer patients with incomplete bowel obstruction. This retrospective study was carried out on a palliative care unit, using an electronic medical record from 2007 to 2009. The intensity of the symptom was evaluated and classified from the medical records on four scales. The frequency of vomiting also was noted from the medical records. During this study period, 20 patients met the inclusion criteria. The average dose of olanzapine was 4.9+/-1.2mg and treatment duration was 23.4+/-16.2 days. Olanzapine treatment led to a significant decrease in the average intensity score of nausea from 2.4+/-0.7 to 0.2+/-0.4 (P<0.001). Of the 20 patients, 18 (90%) experienced a reduction in the intensity of nausea. The average frequency of vomiting significantly decreased after olanzapine treatment from 1.1+/-1.3 times/day (median 0.5; range 0-4) before the treatment to 0.3+/-0.5 times/day (median 0; range 0-1) after the treatment (P<0.01). Before the treatment, 10 patients experienced vomiting; eight of these patients experienced a decrease in the frequency of vomiting with olanzapine treatment. Our study suggests the potential efficacy of olanzapine for relief of nausea in incomplete bowel obstruction. A prospective trial is promising.	3a
19229061	The self-management of uncertainty among men undertaking active surveillance for low-risk prostate cancer.	"Asymptomatic men with low-risk, early-stage prostate cancer are eligible for active surveillance (AS), which offers a means to monitor the cancer while delaying treatment. However, AS operates within a unique set of circumstances that advocate monitoring, rather than immediate treatment, and men's health practices are central to coping with the inherent uncertainty of living with an untreated cancer. A qualitative study was completed to describe the range of men's self-management strategies used to overcome AS-related uncertainty. The study findings reveal two strategies. First, positioning prostate cancer as benign through stoicism and solitary discourses were common to men intent on ""living a normal life."" Second, men committed to ""doing something extra"" complemented AS protocols, and often collaborated with their wives to focus on diet as an adjunct therapy. Although most participants exhibited typical men's health practices, it is clear that tailored AS psychosocial interventions will benefit men and their families."	2a
18074668	Treatment of early-stage glottic cancer by transoral laser resection.	"OBJECTIVES: We reviewed outcomes of treatment of early glottic carcinoma by transoral laser resection. METHODS: We performed a retrospective study of tumor stage, type of cordectomy (European Laryngological Society), resection margins, local control, and laryngeal preservation. RESULTS: Of 142 patients treated with curative intent, 79 (92% male; average age, 63 years) were retained for this study, on the basis of availability of information regarding resection margins, the absence of adjuvant radiotherapy, and followup of at least 2 years. The tumors were classified pTis (n = 21), pT1a (n = 51), or pT1b (n = 7) and were treated by cordectomy types I (23%), II (30%), III (27%), IV (6%), and V (14%). The average follow-up was 56 months (range, 24 to 150 months). The overall 5-year actuarial recurrence-free survival rate was 89%, and the 5-year actuarial disease-specific survival rate was 97.3%. There were 11 local recurrences (14%); 7 were treated by another laser resection, 1 by radiotherapy, 1 by supracricoid partial laryngectomy, and 2 by total laryngectomy. The overall rate of final local control with the laser alone was 100% for patients with initially positive margins, 95% for those with initially suspicious margins, and 94% for those with free margins. The overall rate of organ preservation was 100% for patients with positive or suspicious margins and 96% for those with free margins. Margin status (p = .39), cordectomy type (p = .67), and anterior commissure involvement (p = .16) were not statistically related to recurrence (Kaplan-Meier calculations with nonparametric univariate analysis). The recurrence rate was significantly higher for T1b tumors, however (p = .001). CONCLUSIONS: Laser microresection provides high rates of local control and organ preservation for early glottic cancer. Positive or suspicious margins were not related to recurrence, nor was anterior commissure involvement. This study implies that suspicious margins can be managed with a ""watch-and-wait"" attitude. Re-treatment with laser, external partial laryngectomy, and radiotherapy remain therapeutic options for recurrences."	4
21353412	MR imaging of hepatic metastasis in patients with malignant melanoma: evaluation of suspected lesions screened at contrast-enhanced CT.	PURPOSE: To evaluate the magnetic resonance (MR) imaging feature of suspected hepatic metastasis in patients with malignant melanoma which showed intermediate findings on screened contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT). MATERIALS AND METHODS: MR imaging was performed in 38 patients (22 men, 16 women; mean age, 58 years) whose CECT findings were intermediate. Hepatic metastases had been diagnosed on MR imaging in 23 of the 38 patients. Verification of hepatic metastasis was made by histological examination: ultrasonographic-guided needle biopsy (n=3), autopsy (n=3), and surgical resection (n=1), or by an obvious progression in number and/or size of the lesions on follow-up MR imaging (n=24). Two diagnostic radiologists reviewed MR images by consensus. The median follow-up duration was 14.2 months. RESULTS: Abnormal findings were detected in 31 patients on MR images, and undetected in the remaining seven patients resulting in false-positive on CECT. The mean size of the lesion was 11.0mm. False-positive results were obtained in two lesions which disappeared on follow-up MR imaging. In six patients, lesions were considered as hepatic cysts on MR images. As a result, a total of 35 hepatic metastases were detected on MR images. Of these, 18 patients demonstrated typical melanotic appearance on MR images which showed shortened T1 and T2 relaxation times, and five patients demonstrated atypical melanotic appearance. In 16 patients, extra-hepatic metastases were also developed. CONCLUSION: MR imaging could rule out hepatic metastasis in patients with malignant melanoma which showed intermediate findings on screened CECT, and could detect additional extra-hepatic metastases.	3b
27186202	Investigating the effect of therapeutic touch on the intensity of acute chemotherapy-induced vomiting in breast cancer women under chemotherapy.	BACKGROUND: Nausea and vomiting are the worst and the most prevalent complications experienced by 70-80% of patients. Complementary treatments including therapeutic touch are cost-effective and low-risk, independent nursing interventions. Present research aims at investigating the effect of therapeutic touch on the intensity of acute chemotherapy-induced vomiting in these patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: As a single-blind, randomized clinical trial, the present research was carried out on women with breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy in Isfahan, Iran. The subjects were divided into three groups of control, placebo, and intervention. The intervention was applied to each patient once for 20 min on the aura (human energy field) focusing on solar chakra. Data gathering instruments included demographic questionnaire and acute vomiting intensity scale. RESULTS: There was a significant difference among the three groups (and also after the intervention) (P < 0.0001). Paired comparisons among the groups using Mann-Whitney test showed that there was a statistically significant difference between the control group and the intervention group and between the control group and the placebo group (P < 0.0001). However, there was no significant difference between the placebo and intervention groups (P = 0.07). CONCLUSIONS: Therapeutic touch was effective in reducing vomiting in the intervention group. However, the patients experienced lower-intensity vomiting which may be because of presence of a therapist and probably the reduced anxiety related to an additional intervention. So, further research is recommended considering the placebo group and employing another person in addition to the therapist, who is not skilled for this technique.	2b
27693898	EffenDys-Fentanyl Buccal Tablet for the Relief of Episodic Breathlessness in Patients With Advanced Cancer: A Multicenter, Open-Label, Randomized, Morphine-Controlled, Crossover, Phase II Trial.	CONTEXT: Episodic breathlessness is a frequent and burdensome symptom in cancer patients but pharmacological treatment is limited. OBJECTIVES: To determine time to onset, efficacy, feasibility, and safety of transmucosal fentanyl in comparison to immediate-release morphine for the relief of episodic breathlessness. METHODS: Phase II, investigator-initiated, multicenter, open-label, randomized, morphine-controlled, crossover trial with open-label titration of fentanyl buccal tablet (FBT) in inpatients with incurable cancer. The primary outcome was time to onset of meaningful breathlessness relief. Secondary outcomes were efficacy (breathlessness intensity difference at 10 and 30 minutes; sum of breathlessness intensity difference at 15 and 60 minutes), feasibility, and safety. Study was approved by local ethics committees. RESULTS: Twenty-five of 1341 patients were eligible, 10 patients agreed to participate (four female, mean age 58 +/- 11, mean Karnofsky score 67 +/- 11). Two patients died before final visits and two patients dropped-out because of disease progression leaving six patients for analysis with 61 episodes of breathlessness. Mean time to onset was for FBT 12.7 +/- 10.0 and for immediate-release morphine 23.6 +/- 15.1 minutes with a mean difference of -10.9 minutes (95% CI = -24.5 to 2.7, P = 0.094). Efficacy measures were predominately in favor for FBT. Both interventions were safe. Feasibility failed because of too much study demands for a very ill patient group. CONCLUSION: The description of a faster and greater relief of episodic breathlessness by transmucosal fentanyl versus morphine justifies further evaluation by a full-powered trial.	1a
9853136	Identification of a high-risk clinically localized prostate cancer subgroup receiving maximum benefit from whole-pelvic irradiation.	PURPOSE: We recently identified a progression-free survival advantage for clinically localized high-risk prostate cancer patients receiving whole-pelvic irradiation. We now seek to identify a subgroup most likely to benefit from whole-pelvic irradiation. METHODS: Between October 1987 and December 1995, 506 clinically localized prostate cancer patients were treated with definitive radiotherapy consisting of whole-pelvic irradiation followed by a prostate-only boost, or prostate-only treatment (median follow-up, 35 months vs 30 months). Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) failure was defined as (1) a PSA value > or = 1 ng/mL or (2) a PSA value that rose > or = 0.5 ng/mL in < or = 1 year posttreatment on two consecutive measurements, with the first rise defined as the time of failure. The calculated risk of lymph node positivity (%rLN+) was defined as 2/3 (initial PSA) + 10(Gleason score - 6), with intermediate risk defined as 15% < or = %rLN+ < 35% and highest risk defined as %rLN+ > or = 35%. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed. RESULTS: Intermediate-risk patients receiving whole-pelvic irradiation had significantly improved freedom from PSA failure compared with those receiving prostatic irradiation only (median progression-free survival 39.5 months vs 22.5 months; P < 0.0001); highest-risk patients did not (median progression-free survival 27.2 months vs 20.8 months, P = NS). Multivariate analysis revealed type of radiation treatment to be the most significant independent predictor of outcome (P < 0.0001). DISCUSSIONS: Whole-pelvic radiotherapy most significantly improves the PSA failure-free survival in patients with an intermediate calculated risk of lymph node positivity, suggesting that highest-risk patients may present with distant micrometastases.	2b
23597092	The role of benzodiazepines in breathlessness: a single site, open label pilot of sustained release morphine together with clonazepam.	BACKGROUND: Breathlessness at rest or on minimal exertion despite optimal treatment of underlying cause(s) is distressing and prevalent. Opioids can reduce the intensity of chronic refractory breathlessness and an anxiolytic may be of benefit. This pilot aimed to determine the safety and feasibility of conducting a phase III study on the intensity of breathlessness by adding regular benzodiazepine to low-dose opioid. METHODS: This is a single site, open label phase II study of the addition of regular clonazepam 0.5 mg nocte orally to Kapanol(R) 10 mg (sustained release morphine sulphate) orally mane together with docusate/sennosides in people with modified Medical Research Council Scale >/=2. Breathlessness intensity on day four was the efficacy outcome. Participants could extend for another 10 days if they achieved >15% reduction over their own baseline breathlessness intensity. RESULTS: Eleven people had trial medication (eight males, median age 78 years (68 to 89); all had COPD; median Karnofsky 70 (50 to 80); six were on long-term home oxygen. Ten people completed day four. One person withdrew because of unsteadiness on day four. Five participants reached the 15% reduction, but only three went on to the extension study, all completing without toxicity. CONCLUSION: This study was safe, feasible and there appears to be a group who derive benefits comparable to titrated opioids. Given the widespread use of benzodiazepines for the symptomatic treatment of chronic refractory breathlessness and its poor evidence base, there is justification for a definitive phase III study.	2b
28700086	Antiseptics for burns.	BACKGROUND: Burn wounds cause high levels of morbidity and mortality worldwide. People with burns are particularly vulnerable to infections; over 75% of all burn deaths (after initial resuscitation) result from infection. Antiseptics are topical agents that act to prevent growth of micro-organisms. A wide range are used with the intention of preventing infection and promoting healing of burn wounds. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects and safety of antiseptics for the treatment of burns in any care setting. SEARCH METHODS: In September 2016 we searched the Cochrane Wounds Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE (In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations), Ovid Embase, and EBSCO CINAHL. We also searched three clinical trials registries and references of included studies and relevant systematic reviews. There were no restrictions based on language, date of publication or study setting. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that enrolled people with any burn wound and assessed the use of a topical treatment with antiseptic properties. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently performed study selection, risk of bias assessment and data extraction. MAIN RESULTS: We included 56 RCTs with 5807 randomised participants. Almost all trials had poorly reported methodology, meaning that it is unclear whether they were at high risk of bias. In many cases the primary review outcomes, wound healing and infection, were not reported, or were reported incompletely.Most trials enrolled people with recent burns, described as second-degree and less than 40% of total body surface area; most participants were adults. Antiseptic agents assessed were: silver-based, honey, Aloe Vera, iodine-based, chlorhexidine or polyhexanide (biguanides), sodium hypochlorite, merbromin, ethacridine lactate, cerium nitrate and Arnebia euchroma. Most studies compared antiseptic with a topical antibiotic, primarily silver sulfadiazine (SSD); others compared antiseptic with a non-antibacterial treatment or another antiseptic. Most evidence was assessed as low or very low certainty, often because of imprecision resulting from few participants, low event rates, or both, often in single studies. Antiseptics versus topical antibioticsCompared with the topical antibiotic, SSD, there is low certainty evidence that, on average, there is no clear difference in the hazard of healing (chance of healing over time), between silver-based antiseptics and SSD (HR 1.25, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.67; I(2) = 0%; 3 studies; 259 participants); silver-based antiseptics may, on average, increase the number of healing events over 21 or 28 days' follow-up (RR 1.17 95% CI 1.00 to 1.37; I(2) = 45%; 5 studies; 408 participants) and may, on average, reduce mean time to healing (difference in means -3.33 days; 95% CI -4.96 to -1.70; I(2) = 87%; 10 studies; 979 participants).There is moderate certainty evidence that, on average, burns treated with honey are probably more likely to heal over time compared with topical antibiotics (HR 2.45, 95% CI 1.71 to 3.52; I(2) = 66%; 5 studies; 140 participants).There is low certainty evidence from single trials that sodium hypochlorite may, on average, slightly reduce mean time to healing compared with SSD (difference in means -2.10 days, 95% CI -3.87 to -0.33, 10 participants (20 burns)) as may merbromin compared with zinc sulfadiazine (difference in means -3.48 days, 95% CI -6.85 to -0.11, 50 relevant participants). Other comparisons with low or very low certainty evidence did not find clear differences between groups.Most comparisons did not report data on infection. Based on the available data we cannot be certain if antiseptic treatments increase or reduce the risk of infection compared with topical antibiotics (very low certainty evidence). Antiseptics versus alternative antisepticsThere may be some reduction in mean time to healing for wounds treated with povidone iodine compared with chlorhexidine (MD -2.21 days, 95% CI 0.34 to 4.08). Other evidence showed no clear differences and is of low or very low certainty. Antiseptics versus non-antibacterial comparatorsWe found high certainty evidence that treating burns with honey, on average, reduced mean times to healing in comparison with non-antibacterial treatments (difference in means -5.3 days, 95% CI -6.30 to -4.34; I(2) = 71%; 4 studies; 1156 participants) but this comparison included some unconventional treatments such as amniotic membrane and potato peel. There is moderate certainty evidence that honey probably also increases the likelihood of wounds healing over time compared to unconventional anti-bacterial treatments (HR 2.86, 95% C 1.60 to 5.11; I(2) = 50%; 2 studies; 154 participants).There is moderate certainty evidence that, on average, burns treated with nanocrystalline silver dressings probably have a slightly shorter mean time to healing than those treated with Vaseline gauze (difference in means -3.49 days, 95% CI -4.46 to -2.52; I(2) = 0%; 2 studies, 204 participants), but low certainty evidence that there may be little or no difference in numbers of healing events at 14 days between burns treated with silver xenograft or paraffin gauze (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.59 to 2.16 1 study; 32 participants). Other comparisons represented low or very low certainty evidence.It is uncertain whether infection rates in burns treated with either silver-based antiseptics or honey differ compared with non-antimicrobial treatments (very low certainty evidence). There is probably no difference in infection rates between an iodine-based treatment compared with moist exposed burn ointment (moderate certainty evidence). It is also uncertain whether infection rates differ for SSD plus cerium nitrate, compared with SSD alone (low certainty evidence).Mortality was low where reported. Most comparisons provided low certainty evidence that there may be little or no difference between many treatments. There may be fewer deaths in groups treated with cerium nitrate plus SSD compared with SSD alone (RR 0.22, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.99; I(2) = 0%, 2 studies, 214 participants) (low certainty evidence). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: It was often uncertain whether antiseptics were associated with any difference in healing, infections, or other outcomes. Where there is moderate or high certainty evidence, decision makers need to consider the applicability of the evidence from the comparison to their patients. Reporting was poor, to the extent that we are not confident that most trials are free from risk of bias.	1a
451822	Treatment for melanoma of the lower extremity with intralesional injection of bacille Calmette Guerin and hyperthermic perfusion.	Twenty-seven patients with locally recurrent melanoma of the lower extremity were treated during a six year period. Recurrences were noted with primary lesions, at Clark's level II, III, IV or V, greater than 1.7 millimeters in depth of invasion and included intransit metastases, satellitosis, subcutaneous metastases and combinations of the three. Median time to recurrence was 12 to 14 months whether or not lymphadenectomy had been performed or lymph node metastases were present. Local recurrence was treated initially with intratumor bacille Calmette Guerin; 20 of 27 patients had complete or transient disease control and 14 patients were alive at 1.5 to 55.0 months. More responders reacted to dinitrochlorobenzene and purified protein derivative skin tests, although these parameters did not predict response to therapy. If intratumor bacille Calmette Guerin therapy did not control local disease or if the disease progressed toward the upper third of the thigh, patients underwent hyperthermic perfusion with L-phenylalanine mustard. Nine patients underwent ten therapeutic perfusions with objective response in seven of nine, with five being alive at two to 65 months. Intratumor bacille Calmette Guerin therapy and subsequent hyperthermic perfusion in bacille Calmette Guerin failures are rational treatment alternatives for locally recurrent melanomas of the extremity.	4
10861309	EUROSCAN, a randomized trial of vitamin A and N-acetylcysteine in patients with head and neck cancer or lung cancer. For the EUropean Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Head and Neck and Lung Cancer Cooperative Groups.	BACKGROUND: Preclinical evidence suggests that retinoids and antioxidants may prevent or delay the occurrence of cancer in the upper or lower airways, but such effects have not been reliably established in clinical studies. To assess the chemopreventive effects of vitamin A (retinyl palmitate) and N-acetylcysteine, we conducted a large randomized intervention study in patients with head and neck cancer or with lung cancer, most of whom had a history of smoking. METHODS: From June 1988 through July 1994, a total of 2592 patients (60% with head and neck cancer and 40% with lung cancer) were randomly assigned to receive 1) retinyl palmitate (300000 IU daily for 1 year followed by 150000 IU for a 2(nd) year), 2) N-acetylcysteine (600 mg daily for 2 years), 3) both compounds, or 4) no intervention. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: Of the patients, 93.5% had smoked tobacco at sometime in their lives (and 25% continued to smoke after cancer diagnosis). After a median follow-up of 49 months, 916 patients were reported with an event (recurrence, second primary tumor, or death). No statistically significant difference was observed in overall survival or event-free survival between patients who received retinyl palmitate and patients who did not. Similarly, no difference was seen in overall survival or event-free survival between patients who received N-acetylcysteine and patients who did not. There was a lower incidence of second primary tumors in the no intervention arm, but the difference was not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: A 2-year supplementation of retinyl palmitate and/or N-acetylcysteine resulted in no benefit-in terms of survival, event-free survival, or second primary tumors-for patients with head and neck cancer or with lung cancer, most of whom were previous or current smokers.	1b
17211440	Lack of survival benefit of post-operative radiation therapy in prostate cancer patients with positive lymph nodes.	Randomized data from SWOG 8794 and EORTC 22911 confirm the benefit of post-operative radiation therapy (RT) for selected patients with pT3 prostate cancer (CaP) after radical prostatectomy (RP). However, data regarding the potential benefit of RT for patients post-RP with positive lymph node (+LN) involvement are limited. We analyzed the Surveillance Epidemiology End Results (SEER) registry for population-based data on efficacy of post-operative RT for +LN patients after RP. As LN data have only been captured by SEER since 1988, we analyzed data for 1988-1992, with specific attention to 10-year relative survival (defined as observed survival divided by the survival of a gender-, age- and race-matched population cohort without disease). Specifically analyzed were data for 1921 patients with nonmetastatic prostate cancer who underwent surgery alone, or surgery followed by RT, and who had +LNs documented. SEER does not code the interval between surgery and RT, so the ratio of patients receiving salvage versus adjuvant therapy is unknown. Using follow-up data through 2002, post-diagnosis survival was examined by number of +LNs. There was no significant relative survival benefit for +LN patients receiving post-operative RT (chi(2)P=0.270). These data do not support routine use of post-operative RT for patients with +LNs in the surgical specimen.	2b
26181286	Clinical Management of Multiple Melanoma Brain Metastases: A Systematic Review.	IMPORTANCE: The treatment of multiple brain metastases (MBM) from melanoma is controversial and includes surgical resection, stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), and whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT). Several new classes of agents have revolutionized the treatment of metastatic melanoma, allowing some subsets of patients to have long-term survival. Given this, management of MBM from melanoma is continually evolving. OBJECTIVE: To review the current evidence regarding the treatment of MBM from melanoma. EVIDENCE REVIEW: The PubMed database was searched using combinations of search terms and synonyms for melanoma, brain metastases, radiation, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and targeted therapy published between January 1, 1995, and January 1, 2015. Articles were selected for inclusion on the basis of targeted keyword searches, manual review of bibliographies, and whether the article was a clinical trial, large observational study, or retrospective study focusing on melanoma brain metastases. Of 2243 articles initially identified, 110 were selected for full review. Of these, the most pertinent 73 articles were included. FINDINGS: Patients with newly diagnosed MBM can be treated with various modalities, either alone or in combination. Level 1 evidence supports the use of SRS alone, WBRT, and SRS with WBRT. Although the addition of WBRT to SRS improves the overall brain relapse rate, WBRT has no significant impact on overall survival and has detrimental neurocognitive outcomes. Cytotoxic chemotherapy has largely been ineffective; targeted therapies and immunotherapies have been reported to have high response rates and deserve further attention in larger clinical trials. Further studies are needed to fully evaluate the efficacy of these novel regimens in combination with radiation therapy. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: At this time, the standard management for patients with MBM from melanoma includes SRS, WBRT, or a combination of both. Emerging data exist to support the notion that SRS in combination with targeted therapies or immune therapy may obviate the need for WBRT; prospective studies are required to fully evaluate the efficacy of these novel regimens in combination with radiation therapy.	1a
16791462	Sonographic evaluation of clinically occult in-transit and satellite metastases from cutaneous malignant melanoma.	PURPOSE: Our purpose was to assess the potential of ultrasonography (US) in the detection of in-transit or satellite metastases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Following a review of the relevant literature, we present the results of a retrospective study based on 2,000 malignant melanoma patients with complete case records. Of these, we selected 600 patients who had a thick melanoma (>1 mm) at presentation but were clinically free of in-transit or satellite melanoma metastases during follow-up. All patients underwent periodic clinical and imaging investigations, as well as US examination of the site of the surgical wound and surrounding soft tissues. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: US raised the suspicion of in-transit or satellite metastases in 63 patients. A total of 95 lesions were identified. Average lesion diameter was 0.7 mm, and only four were larger than 1 cm. All suspected lesions were confirmed by surgery, follow-up or US-guided fine-needle aspiration (FNA) with 22-gauge needles using a freehand technique and exploiting the capillarity principle. In this series, there were apparently no false positive or false negative US results although inclusion criteria precluded correct evaluation of possible false negatives. Minimum lesion diameter allowing sonographic detection appears to be around 0.4 mm. US features of in-transit metastases have been well documented. They usually appear as solid lesions, hypoechoic relative to the surrounding subcutaneous fat and with relatively well-defined and regular contours and good US transmission. Internal structure is fairly homogeneous, and sometimes millimetresized fluid areas can be appreciated inside. Larger metastatic lesions may exhibit internal vascular signals at power Doppler imaging. These findings in dermatological sonography are almost exclusive of metastases but may also be seen in glomangioma, which, however, has intense intralesional vascularity. US-guided FNA plays an important role in diagnosis of metastases from malignant melanoma. Of the 32 nodules that were cytologically sampled, a definitive or most probable diagnosis of metastasis was made for nodules with a mean diameter of 0.7 mm (minimum 0.5 mm). CONCLUSIONS: Sonography of soft tissues surrounding the original site of a malignant melanoma should be more widely used and associated with US-guided FNA biopsy.	4
17997026	First analysis of the long-term results with transrectal HIFU in patients with localised prostate cancer.	OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the long-term efficacy of high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) therapy for patients with localised prostate cancer. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Patients included in this multicentre analysis had T1-T2 NxM0 prostate cancer, a PSA<15 ng/ml, and a Gleason score (GS) < or = 7, and were treated with prototypes or first-generation Ablatherm HIFU devices between October 1997 and August 2001. The Phoenix definition of biochemical failure was used (PSA nadir+2). Treatment failure was defined as: biochemical failure or positive biopsy. RESULTS: A total of 140 patients with a mean (SD) age 69.1 yr (6.6) were included. Mean (SD) follow-up was 6.4 yr (1.1). Control prostate biopsies were negative in 86.4% of patients. Median PSA nadir of 0.16 ng/ml (range, 0.0-9.1) was achieved at a mean (SD) of 4.9 mo (5.2). A PSA nadir < or = 0.5 ng/ml was recorded in 68.4% of patients. The actuarial biochemical failure-free survival rates (SR) at 5 and 7 yr were 77% and 69%, respectively. The actuarial disease-free SR at 5 and 7 yr were 66% and 59%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the effective long-term cancer control achieved with HIFU in patients with low- or intermediate-risk localised prostate cancer.	3a
9738776	Multiple primary melanomas.	BACKGROUND: The diagnosis of primary melanoma increases the risk of additional primary melanomas. OBJECTIVE: We characterize the subgroup of patients with multiple melanomas. METHODS: We reviewed the melanoma database. RESULTS: Sixty patients with multiple primary melanomas were identified. Twelve (20%) experienced melanomas in the same regional location, 43 (72%) in different locations, and 5 (8%) in both the same and different locations (> 2 melanomas). Eighteen (30%) were diagnosed concurrently with multiple melanomas, 38 (63%) subsequently, and 4 (7%) concurrently and subsequently (>2 melanomas). Forty-two percent of subsequent melanomas occurred within 3 years of the initial lesion diagnosis, 9 (17%) between 3 and 7 years, and 22 (42%) after more than 7 years. Subsequent melanomas were thinner in 70% of cases (P = .05). The mean age at first melanoma diagnosis was 38 and 59 years, respectively, for those with and without dysplastic nevi (P < .001). CONCLUSION: In patients with multiple melanomas, subsequent melanomas often occur in different regional locations several years after diagnosis of the initial lesion.	3b
21480136	Survival after pulmonary metastasectomy in patients with malignant melanoma.	BACKGROUND: Surgical resection is an important interdisciplinary treatment for pulmonary metastases of metastatic malignant melanoma. The purpose of this study was to determine the clinical course, outcome and prognostic factors in a subset of patients recently treated by metastasectomy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Between 1995 and 2007, 30 patients (19 men, 11 women) with pulmonary metastases from malignant melanoma underwent pulmonary resection. Exclusion of primary tumor recurrence and other extrapulmonary metastases was mandatory for inclusion in the study. The median follow-up was 93.7 months. These patients' records were subsequently reviewed. RESULTS: Cumulative 5-year survival rate after pulmonary resection was 35.1% with a median survival of 18.3 months. Complete pulmonary resection was achieved in 27 patients who had a median survival of 20.5 months compared to 13.0 months after incomplete resection; however, completeness of resection was not a statistically prognostic factor for survival. Multivariate analysis identified gender as the only significant prognostic parameter for overall survival in the group of patients after complete resection of pulmonary metastases, with 9.4 months versus 25.0 months for the female and male group, respectively ( P = 0.022). CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that pulmonary metastasectomy for metastases of malignant melanoma is a safe treatment modality which may actually be of benefit in selected patients with stage IV malignant melanoma. When pulmonary metastases of malignant melanoma are present, every attempt should be made to completely resect all clinically detected metastases.	3b
21300466	Concomitant cisplatin and hyperfractionated radiotherapy in locally advanced head and neck cancer: 10-year follow-up of a randomized phase III trial (SAKK 10/94).	PURPOSE: To compare the long-term outcome of treatment with concomitant cisplatin and hyperfractionated radiotherapy versus treatment with hyperfractionated radiotherapy alone in patients with locally advanced head and neck cancer. METHODS AND MATERIALS: From July 1994 to July 2000, a total of 224 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck were randomized to receive either hyperfractionated radiotherapy alone (median total dose, 74.4 Gy; 1.2 Gy twice daily; 5 days per week) or the same radiotherapy combined with two cycles of cisplatin (20 mg/m(2) for 5 consecutive days during weeks 1 and 5). The primary endpoint was the time to any treatment failure; secondary endpoints were locoregional failure, metastatic failure, overall survival, and late toxicity assessed according to Radiation Therapy Oncology Group criteria. RESULTS: Median follow-up was 9.5 years (range, 0.1-15.4 years). Median time to any treatment failure was not significantly different between treatment arms (hazard ratio [HR], 1.2 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.9-1.7; p = 0.17]). Rates of locoregional failure-free survival (HR, 1.5 [95% CI, 1.1-2.1; p = 0.02]), distant metastasis-free survival (HR, 1.6 [95% CI, 1.1-2.5; p = 0.02]), and cancer-specific survival (HR, 1.6 [95% CI, 1.0-2.5; p = 0.03]) were significantly improved in the combined-treatment arm, with no difference in major late toxicity between treatment arms. However, overall survival was not significantly different (HR, 1.3 [95% CI, 0.9-1.8; p = 0.11]). CONCLUSIONS: After long-term follow-up, combined-treatment with cisplatin and hyperfractionated radiotherapy maintained improved rates of locoregional control, distant metastasis-free survival, and cancer-specific survival compared to that of hyperfractionated radiotherapy alone, with no difference in major late toxicity.	1b
23942774	Efficacy and safety of ipilimumab in metastatic melanoma patients surviving more than 2 years following treatment in a phase III trial (MDX010-20).	BACKGROUND: In a phase III trial (ClinicalTrials.gov registration ID: NCT00094653), ipilimumab significantly improved survival versus a vaccine control in pretreated patients with metastatic melanoma. Here, we characterize outcomes of those patients who survived >/= 2 years. METHODS: Patients were randomized (3 : 1 : 1) to receive ipilimumab 3 mg/kg + gp100 vaccine, ipilimumab 3 mg/kg + placebo, or gp100 vaccine alone. Baseline demographic data, duration of survival, responses, and safety among patients with >/= 2 years' survival were analyzed. RESULTS: Among 676 randomized patients, 474 and 259 patients had at least 2 or 3 years of potential follow-up, respectively, and were eligible for analysis. Among these, 94 (20%) and 42 (16%) survived >/= 2 and >/= 3 years, respectively. Survival rates at 2 and 3 years were 25% (24 of 95) and 25% (13 of 53) with ipilimumab alone and 19% (54 of 284) and 15% (24 of 156) with ipilimumab plus gp100. Safety among patients with >/= 2 years' survival was comparable with the overall study population, with the onset of new ipilimumab-related toxic effect (all grades) reported in 6 of 78 (8%) patients. CONCLUSIONS: Ipilimumab results in survival of >/= 2 years in one-fifth of pretreated patients with 2 years potential follow-up in a phase III trial. New onset, low-grade events starting after administration of the last dose were infrequent. TRIAL REGISTRATION ID: NCT00094653.	2b
21712288	Short-term opioids for breathlessness in stable chronic heart failure: a randomized controlled trial.	AIMS: To assess the effect of oral opioids vs. placebo on breathlessness in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF). METHODS AND RESULTS: Oral morphine (Oramorph), oral oxycodone (Oxynorm), and placebo were studied in an outpatient setting. Once randomized, participants received all three interventions in a controlled double-blind crossover trial for 4 days each, with a 3-day washout between interventions. Patients known to the Hull and East Yorkshire Academic Cardiology department with CHF (New York Heart Association Grade III-IV) were invited to participate. Participants were eligible if they were on standard medical therapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers, and diuretics. Participant-rated change in 11-point numerical rating scale (NRS) (average over previous 24 h) breathlessness severity score from baseline (Day 1) to Day 4 of treatment was the primary outcome measure. The study was powered to detect a one-point change in severity.Thirty-nine patients were randomized and 35 completed all three study arms. Breathlessness severity was reduced from baseline with all three interventions. There was no statistically significant difference between active intervention and placebo or between the two types of opioid for the primary endpoint [-1.37 in NRS score for placebo group vs. -0.41 in morphine group (P = 0.13) and -1.29 for oxycodone group (P = 0.90)]. The response to treatment was not affected by aetiology, severity of CHF, or concurrent drug therapy. Opioid administration did not cause detrimental changes in clinical observations and was well tolerated. CONCLUSION: We demonstrated no benefit over placebo for the relief of breathlessness with short-term low-dose oral opioids for CHF patients. Trial registered prior to the recruitment of the first participant with Current Controlled Trials (www.controlled-trials.com; Trial number ISRCTN 85268059).	1a
24417532	Sun safety among farmers and farmworkers: a review.	Farmers and farmworkers face increased risks of skin cancer from exposure to solar ultraviolet radiation (UVR) when working outdoors. The objective of this study was to evaluate the evidence from behavioral and intervention studies from the peer-reviewed studies related to sun safety among farmers and farmworkers and identify any gaps in the literature. A comprehensive review was conducted between 1990 and 2013; 22 studies were identified related to behavior and health interventions of sun safety among these targeted groups. The inconsistency of data collection methods makes it difficult to estimate with accuracy any overall meaningful results of behavior. However, from the studies reviewed, farmers and farmworkers most frequently reported wearing some type of hat (23.6%-100%) as a primary method of protection from the sun when working outdoors. Female farmers were more likely than male farmers to use sunscreen and engage in indoor tanning behavior. All sun safety educational interventions studies reviewed reported positive increases in behavioral change. To a large degree, adequate sun protection is lacking and varies geographically among farmers. Although targeted education is key to making improvements on sun protection behavior, aggressive attempts have to be made. Studies related to farmworkers, sun safety behavior, and skin cancer are scarce and more research is needed in this area.	1a
19380362	Laser surgery for early glottic cancer: impact of margin status on local control and organ preservation.	OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of margin status on disease-free survival, overall survival, and organ preservation in early glottic cancer treated by endoscopic laser surgery. DESIGN: Prospective nonrandomized study. SETTING: Tertiary referral center. PATIENTS: A total of 274 patients with untreated (possibly biopsied) cTis, cT1a/b, cT2, cN0 glottic cancer; adequate exposure of the glottic region; no contraindications to general anesthesia; and the ability to give informed consent. INTERVENTIONS: European Laryngological Society laser cordectomy. Patients with negative margins (>1 mm) were followed, patients with close margins (< or =1 mm) or 1 positive margin (tumor on margin) had another operation, and patients with more than 1 positive margin had postoperative radiotherapy. Median follow-up was 58 months. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Eight-year disease-free survival, 5-year overall survival, and organ preservation rate. RESULTS: Margins were negative in 180 patients, close in 40, and positive in 54. A second laser resection was performed in 36 of 94 patients with close or positive margins. Radiotherapy was administered to 36 patients. Patients with close or positive margins who did not undergo further treatment had a greater recurrence risk (hazard ratio, 2.53; 95% confidence interval, 0.97-6.59, P = .06) than did those with negative margins, mainly owing to relapses in 5 of the 8 protocol breakers with positive margins not treated further. Eight-year relapse-free survival was 88.2%, 5-year overall survival was 90.9%, and the larynx was preserved in 97.1%. CONCLUSIONS: Laser removal of early glottic cancer is oncologically adequate with margins greater than 1 mm from the tumor edge. Positive margins require further treatment; close margins may require further treatment depending on tumor characteristics.	2b
19687401	Regional control of melanoma neck node metastasis after selective neck dissection with or without adjuvant radiotherapy.	OBJECTIVE: To examine the effect of adjuvant radiotherapy on regional control of melanoma neck node metastasis. DESIGN: A single-institution retrospective study. SETTING: Tertiary care cancer center. PATIENTS: The study included 64 patients with melanoma neck node metastasis who were treated with neck dissection between 1989 and 2004 in The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam. Twenty-four patients were treated with surgery only (15 modified radical neck dissections [MRNDs] and 9 selective neck dissections [SNDs]) (S group), and 40 patients underwent surgery (28 MRNDs and 12 SNDs) and adjuvant radiotherapy (S+RT group). RESULTS: Prognostic factors, ie, number of nodes, size of nodes, and extracapsular extension, were worse in the S+RT group. With a median follow-up of 2.5 years, the 2-year ipsilateral regional recurrence (RR) rate was 18% in the S+RT group and 46% in the S group. This 28% difference in RR was not statistically significant (P = .16). However, evaluation of the effect of adjuvant RT in multivariate analysis revealed a significant reduction of the RR rate after correction for the number of involved nodes (P = .04). In the S group, SND was associated with a trend toward worse RR rate compared with MRND but was not statistically significant in univariate analysis (P = .08). The type of neck dissection did not influence the RR rate in the S+RT group (P = .60). Three of the 4 RRs occurred outside the dissected volume after SND in the S group. CONCLUSIONS: Based on our findings, we conclude that, compared with extended neck dissection, SND leads to inferior regional control in patients with melanoma neck node metastasis who are not treated with RT, even those with low-risk neck disease. Furthermore, our results suggest that adjuvant RT improves regional control in patients with 2 or more involved nodes.	3b
26771294	Effect of Curcumin Supplementation During Radiotherapy on Oxidative Status of Patients with Prostate Cancer: A Double Blinded, Randomized, Placebo-Controlled Study.	Curcumin is an antioxidant agent with both radiosensitizing and radioprotective properties. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of curcumin supplementation on oxidative status of patients with prostate cancer who undergo radiotherapy. Forty patients treated with radiotherapy for prostate cancer were randomized to the curcumin (CG, n = 20) or placebo group (PG, n = 20). They received curcumin (total 3 g/day) or placebo during external-beam radiation therapy of up to 74 Gy. Plasma total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) were measured at baseline and 3 mo after radiotherapy completion. Analysis of covariance was used to compare the variables between groups following the intervention. Serum PSA levels and MRI/MRS images were investigated. In CG, TAC significantly increased (P < 0.001) and the activity of SOD decreased (P = 0.018) after radiotherapy compared with those at baseline. In CG, however, the activity of SOD had a significant reduction (P = 0.026) and TAC had a significant increase (P = 0.014) compared with those in PG. PSA levels were reduced to below 0.2 ng/ml in both groups, 3 mo after treatment, however, no significant differences were observed between the 2 groups regarding treatment outcomes.	1b
16887293	Second malignancies after prostate brachytherapy: incidence of bladder and colorectal cancers in patients with 15 years of potential follow-up.	PURPOSE: To report the incidence of second bladder and colorectal cancers after prostate brachytherapy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: This review included 125 patients treated with I-125 brachytherapy alone, and 223 patients who received supplemental external beam radiation therapy. Median follow-up was 10.5 years. Patients were followed for the development of lower genitourinary and colorectal cancers. Second malignancies arising five years after radiation therapy were defined as being potentially associated with treatment; observed rates were then compared with age-matched expected rates according to Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results data. RESULTS: Five years out of treatment, there were 15 patients with a second solid tumor, including bladder cancer (n = 11), colorectal cancer (n = 3), and prostatic urethra cancer (n = 1). The incidence of second malignancy was no different in patients treated with brachytherapy alone (1.6%) vs. those receiving external beam radiotherapy (5.8%, p = 0.0623). There were more observed bladder cancers compared with those expected (relative risk, 2.34, 95% confidence interval 0.96-3.72; absolute excess risk 35 cancers per 10,000 patients). Relative risk did not significantly change over increasing follow-up intervals up to 20 years after treatment. CONCLUSIONS: There may be an increased but small risk of developing a second malignancy after radiation therapy for prostate cancer. This outcome could be related to radiation carcinogenesis, but more vigilant screening and thorough workup as a result of radiation side effects and predisposing conditions (e.g., genetic and environmental factors) in many of the patients found to have second malignancies likely contributed to the higher number of observed malignancies than expected.	3a
24690243	FDG PET in early stage cutaneous malignant melanoma.	INTRODUCTION: Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG PET) is not recommended in early stage melanoma; however, a significant number of cases are referred to our institution for FDG PET. We refer to early stage disease as American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage I and II, which includes all cases without metastases. A retrospective review was undertaken to determine the clinical utility of FDG PET in this patient group. METHODS: A retrospective study of FDG scans on all patients presenting to the WA PET Centre with early stage melanoma over a 5(1/2) year period was undertaken. The positivity rate of the initial study for detection of malignant melanoma was determined. In patients with an initially negative FDG PET, the time from initial diagnosis to a positive surveillance study was determined. Both the initial positivity rate and time to a positive study were correlated with Breslow staging. RESULTS: Three hundred twenty-two patients were included in the study, of which 74 had initial positive FDG PET scans (23%). Adequate follow-up was available in 51 patients with the PET result confirmed as true positive in 37 (positive predictive value 73%). One hundred eight of 248 patients initially negative had follow-up scans during the follow-up period, of which 48 became positive. The 73% of recurrences were over 12 months post-diagnosis. No correlation with Breslow thickness was demonstrated. CONCLUSION: Despite FDG PET not being recommended for early cutaneous malignant melanoma, 27% of melanoma cases referred for FDG PET during the study period were AJCC stage I or II. Our results suggest FDG PET in early stage melanoma demonstrates occult disease in 17% of cases.	3a
19429579	Long-term survival of uveal melanoma patients after surgery for liver metastases.	AIMS: To evaluate the posthepatectomy survival of uveal melanoma patients with liver metastases. METHODS: Data were collected from the files in the Departments of Ophthalmology, General Surgery and Oncology, for uveal melanoma patients who were seen in the Ocular Oncology Clinic at the Hadassah Medical Center from 1988 to 2007. The main outcome was posthepatectomy survival. Statistical analysis was performed using JMP statistical software. RESULTS: Of the 558 patients, 74 (13%) developed metastases after a median of 35.0 months from the initial diagnosis. Thirty-five patients underwent hepatectomy. These patients had similar clinical characteristics as those who did not undergo hepatectomy. The median survival time from the detection of metastasis was 3.7-fold higher in the operated patients in comparison with the non-operated patients. Posthepatectomy survival of patients who were found in surgery to have 1-5 metastatic nodules was 3.1 times longer than those with six or more lesions. The hepatectomies of 13 patients resulted in complete resection of the hepatic metastases with clean histological margins (R0). These patients survived 1.9 times longer than those with residual disease (R1/R2). CONCLUSION: It is possible to extend significantly the life expectancy of uveal melanoma patients who develop isolated hepatic metastases by complete resection of the lesions.	4
17443520	Inhaled corticosteroids for stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.	BACKGROUND: The role of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has been the subject of much controversy. Major international guidelines recommend selective use of ICS. Recently published meta-analyses have reported conflicting findings on the effects of inhaled steroid therapy in COPD. OBJECTIVES: The objective of the review is to determine the efficacy of regular use of inhaled corticosteroids in patients with stable COPD. SEARCH STRATEGY: A pre-defined search strategy was used to search the Cochrane Airways Group specialised register for relevant literature. Searches are current as of October 2006. SELECTION CRITERIA: We selected randomised trials comparing any dose of any type of inhaled steroid with a placebo control in patients with COPD. Acute bronchodilator reversibility to short term beta2-agonists and bronchial hyperresponsiveness were not exclusion criteria. The a priori primary outcome was change in lung function. Data on mortality, exacerbations, quality of life and symptoms, rescue bronchodilator use, exercise capacity, biomarkers and safety were also analysed. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Study authors were contacted for additional information. Adverse effects information was collected from the trials. MAIN RESULTS: Forty-seven primary studies with 13,139 participants met the inclusion criteria. Medium term use of ICS (> two months and up to six months) resulted in a small improvement in FEV1 in some studies. Long term use of ICS (> six months) did not significantly reduce the rate of decline in FEV1 in COPD patients (weighted mean difference (WMD) 5.80 ml/year with ICS over placebo, 95% CI -0.28 to 11.88, 2333 participants). There was no statistically significant effect on mortality in COPD patients (OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.16, 8390 participants). Long term use of ICS reduced the mean rate of exacerbations in those studies where pooling of data was possible (WMD -0.26 exacerbations per patient per year, 95% CI -0.37 to -0.14, 2586 participants). ICS slowed the rate of decline in quality of life, as measured by the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (WMD -1.22 units/year, 95% CI -1.83 to -0.60, 2507 participants). Response to ICS was not predicted by oral steroid response, bronchodilator reversibility or bronchial hyper-responsiveness in COPD patients. There was an increased risk of oropharyngeal candidiasis (OR 2.49, 95% CI 1.78 to 3.49, 4380 participants) and hoarseness. The few long term studies that measured bone effects generally showed no major effect on fractures and bone mineral density over 3 years. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Patients and clinicians should balance the potential benefits of inhaled steroids in COPD (reduced rate of exacerbations, reduced rate of decline in quality of life), against the known increase in local side effects (oropharyngeal candidiasis and hoarseness). The risk of long term adverse effects is unknown.	1a
18158764	Role of FDG-PET in the assessment of survival prognosis in melanoma.	Positron-emission tomography (PET) employing fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) has proven to be a highly sensitive and specific diagnostic method in the staging and restaging of various neoplasms, including melanoma, complementing morphologic imaging. FDG uptake has been correlated with proliferation rate, and thus, the degree of malignancy of a given tumor (i.e., grading). Consecutively, a relationship of survival prognosis and the extent of tumor burden as well as degree of FDG accumulation--determined by FDG-PET--has been suggested in various tumors. The aim of this study was to assess the potential of fluor-18-FDG-PET in order to evaluate the survival prognosis in melanoma. Patient data (n=95) were retrospectively analyzed, and the results of functional FDG-PET staging was correlated with survival data. Time of staging (diagnosis of primary versus recurrence) had no statistically significant effect on survival prognosis when patients were matched for pertaining node metastasis (NM) stages. Differences in survival were owing to the presence of metastatic disease rather than time of staging. Tumor (T)-stage (T1-T4) alone had no effect on survival prognosis when patients were matched for NM stages. Differences in survival were also due to higher rates of lymph node (LN) and organ metastases in higher T-stages. Detection of LN metastases (N1M0) had a statistically significant and predominant impact on 5-year survival (N0M0 80% versus N1M0 45%; p<0.01). Additional presence of distant metastases in LN-positive patients (N1M1) had only a statistically insignificant further impact on survival (5-year survival in N1M0 45% versus N1M1 29%; p>0.05). Exclusive presence of organ metastases (N0M1) showed a statistically significant drop of survival with a 5-year survival of 61% in N0M1 versus 80% in N0M0, respectively (p<0.03). Further, the combined presence of LN and distant metastases had the worst prognosis (5-year survival in N1M1 29% versus N0M1 61%; p<0.02). Based on a qualitative 4-point scoring system, patients with malignancy-typical FDG uptake showed an overall 5-year survival of 38%, as compared to patients with malignancy-suspicious lesions (71%; p <or= 0.02) or patients without evidence of disease (80%; p<0.001). When PET and computed tomography (CT) findings were compared, survival was best in patients with both studies (CT and PET) being negative (5-year survival, 83%), worst when PET and CT were positive (5-year survival, 61%; p<0.02), and showed an intermediate survival when PET was positive, but with CT still negative (5-year survival, 73%). In patients staged by FDG-PET, significant risk factors--as identified by univariate und multivariate analyses--were (i) malignancy-typical FDG uptake, (ii) detection of LN, and (iii) organ metastases. In conclusion, FDG-PET offers valid prognostic information, demonstrating a good relationship of functional TNM-stage and actual survival prognosis. The results obtained in one PET study seem to be as suitable as the combined results of conventional staging, including clinical and morphologic (e.g., CT) methods and clinical follow-up. FDG-PET was more accurate in tumor detection and seemed to detect tumor spread earlier, as compared to CT.	3b
9766290	Effects of dialogue and therapeutic touch on preoperative and postoperative experiences of breast cancer surgery: an exploratory study.	PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES: To obtain preliminary data and determine the feasibility of a large-scale experimental study to test the efficacy of the Rogerian Science of Unitary Human Beings-based intervention of dialogue and therapeutic touch (TT) on pre- and postoperative anxiety and mood and postoperative pain from breast cancer surgery. DESIGN: Experimental. SETTING: Mid-Atlantic region; ambulatory. SAMPLE: 29 Caucasian and 2 African American English-speaking women with positive breast cancer biopsy (experimental, n = 14; control, n = 17), ranging in age from 31-84 years old (F = 55.6). METHODS: Treatments administered in subjects' homes within seven days prior to surgery and 24 hours after hospital discharge. Experimental treatment consisted of 10 minutes of TT and 20 minutes of dialogue. Control treatment consisted of 10 minutes of quiet time and 20 minutes of dialogue. Data (Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. Affects Balance Scale, and Visual Analog Scale-Pain) were collected at the conclusion of each home visit. MAIN RESEARCH VARIABLES: Anxiety, mood, and pain. FINDINGS: The experimental group had lower preoperative state anxiety than the control groups (p = 0.008). No difference was found for preoperative mood. No differences were found for any postoperative measure. CONCLUSIONS: A large-scale study of dialogue and TT would require changes in design and recruitment strategies. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE: Nurses may provide more comprehensive care by incorporating dialogue and TT or quiet time into their pre- and postoperative care. Additional research, however, is recommended to determine the differential effects of dialogue, TT, and quiet time on women's experiences with breast cancer prior to incorporating these noninvasive modalities into clinical practice.	2b
10362098	Endogenous sex hormones and prostate cancer: a quantitative review of prospective studies.	This paper presents a quantitative review of the data from eight prospective epidemiological studies, comparing mean serum concentrations of sex hormones in men who subsequently developed prostate cancer with those in men who remained cancer free. The hormones reviewed have been postulated to be involved in the aetiology of prostate cancer: androgens and their metabolites testosterone (T), non-SHBG-bound testosterone (non-SHBG-bound T), di-hydrotestosterone (DHT), androstanediol glucuronide (A-diol-g), androstenedione (A-dione), dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (DHEAS), sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), the oestrogens, oestrone and oestradiol, luteinizing hormone (LH) and prolactin. The ratio of the mean hormone concentration in prostate cancer cases to that of controls (and its 95% confidence interval (CI)) was calculated for each study, and the results summarized by calculating the weighted average of the log ratios. No differences in the average concentrations of the hormones were found between prostate cancer cases and controls, with the possible exception of A-diol-g which exhibited a 5% higher mean serum concentration among cases relative to controls (ratio 1.05, 95% CI 1.00-1.11), based on 644 cases and 1048 controls. These data suggest that there are no large differences in circulating hormones between men who subsequently go on to develop prostate cancer and those who remain free of the disease. Further research is needed to substantiate the small difference found in A-diol-g concentrations between prostate cancer cases and controls.	2a
18766034	Interactive digital education aid in breast reconstruction.	BACKGROUND: An interactive digital education aid for breast reconstruction patients was developed because of a perceived need to provide patients with more education regarding the treatment so that they can make better informed treatment decisions. A prospective randomized study was conducted to assess its effectiveness. METHODS: Breast cancer patients who were candidates for breast reconstruction were recruited and randomized into a control group and a study group. Both groups received routine assessment and education in the plastic surgery clinic, but the study group also watched the interactive digital education aid. Questionnaires assessing knowledge, anxiety, and satisfaction were administered (1) before the initial plastic surgery consultation, (2) immediately before surgery, and (3) 1 month after surgery. RESULTS: A total of 133 women participated, 66 in the control group and 67 in the study group. Women in both groups showed decreased anxiety, increased knowledge, and enhanced satisfaction with their decision-making ability associated with preoperative instructions about reconstructive surgery. However, the study group was significantly more satisfied than the control group with the method of receiving information and showed a less steep learning curve regarding the different techniques of breast reconstruction. They also tended to have a reduced mean level of anxiety and increased satisfaction with the treatment choice compared with the control group. CONCLUSIONS: An interactive digital education aid is a beneficial educational adjunct for patients contemplating breast reconstruction. Patients who use an interactive digital education aid demonstrate greater factual knowledge, reduced anxiety, and increased postoperative satisfaction compared with patients given preoperative instructions using standard methods alone. The benefit of an interactive digital education aid is expected to be higher in a broad-based practice setting outside of a comprehensive cancer center.	1b
23322191	Epidural methadone results in dose-dependent analgesia in cancer pain, further enhanced by epidural dexamethasone.	BACKGROUND: This study was designed to evaluate the role of epidural methadone-lidocaine in cancer pain combined or not to epidural dexamethasone. METHODS: In all, 72 cancer patients, 32- to 67-year-old were randomized to six groups (n=12) and prospectively studied to examine analgesia and adverse effects for 3 weeks. Patients received single-dose protocol epidural test drugs: Control group (CG) received epidural 40-mg lidocaine diluted to 10-ml volume with saline. Dexamethasone group (DG) 40-mg lidocaine plus 10-mg dexamethasone. The 2.5MetG 2.5-mg epidural methadone with 40-mg lidocaine; the 5MetG, 5-mg epidural methadone plus 40-mg lidocaine, the 7.5MetG, 7.5-mg epidural methadone plus 40-mg lidocaine and finally the 7.5Met-DexG, 7.5-mg methadone with 40-mg lidocaine and 10-mg dexamethasone. RESULTS: Groups CG, DG and 2.5MetG were similar regarding analgesia and side effects. Patients from 5MetG and 7.5MetG took 3 +/- 1 and 5 +/- 1 days, respectively, to restart oral morphine. Patients from 7.5MetDG took 14 +/- 2 to restart oral morphine (P<0.001). Daily somnolence and appetite improved in the 7.5MetDG during 2-week evaluation (P<0.005). Fatigue improved for both DG and 7.5MetDG during 2-week evaluation (P<0.005). By the third week of evaluation, all patients were similar. CONCLUSIONS: Epidural methadone plus lidocaine resulted in dose-dependent analgesia, further improved by epidural dexamethasone, which also improved fatigue.	1a
21606835	Pancreatic cancer surgery in the new millennium: better prediction of outcome.	BACKGROUND: Surgery is the only therapy with potentially curative intention in pancreatic cancer. This analysis aimed to determine prognostic parameters in a patient cohort with resected pancreatic adenocarcinoma with a special focus on the revised R1-definition. METHODS: Between October 2001 and August 2009, data from 1071 consecutively resected patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma were prospectively collected in an electronical database. Parameters tested for survival prediction in univariate analysis included patient, tumor, and resection characteristics as well as adjuvant therapy. The parameters with significant results were used for multivariate survival analysis. Identified parameters with positive or negative prognostic effect were used to define risk groups and to assess the effects on patient survival. RESULTS: Age, ASA-score, CEA and CA19-9 levels, preoperative insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, T-, N-, M-, R-, G-tumor classification, advanced disease, and LNR were all significant in univariate analysis, whereas gender, NYHA score, BMI, insurance status, type of surgical procedure, and adjuvant therapy were not. In multivariate analysis, age >/=70 years, preoperative insulin-dependent diabetes, CA19-9 >/=400 U/mL, T4-, M1- or G3-status, and LNR > 0.2 were independent negative predictors, whereas Tis/T1/T2-status, G1-differentiation, and R0-status (revised definition) were independently associated with good prognosis. Using these risk factors, patients were stratified into 4 risk-groups with significantly different prognosis; 5-year survival varied between 0% and 54.5%. Risk stratification resulted in improved survival prognostication within the predominant AJCC IIA and AJCC IIB stages. CONCLUSIONS: A newly defined prognostic profiling including the revised R1-definition discriminates survival of patients with resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma better than the AJCC staging system, and may be of particular relevance for patient-adjusted therapy in the heterogeneous group of AJCC stage II tumors.	2b
32168393	Health education interventions to promote early presentation and referral for women with symptoms of endometrial cancer.	BACKGROUND: Diagnosis of endometrial (womb) cancer is normally made at an early stage, as most women with the disease experience abnormal vaginal bleeding, which prompts them to seek medical advice. However, delays in presentation and referral can result in delay in diagnosis and management, which can lead to unfavourable treatment outcomes. This is particularly a problem for pre- and peri-menopausal women. Providing educational information to women and healthcare providers regarding symptoms relating to endometrial cancer may raise awareness of the disease and reduce delayed treatment. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of health education interventions targeting healthcare providers, or individuals, or both, to promote early presentation and referral for women with endometrial cancer symptoms. SEARCH METHODS: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE and Embase. We also searched registers of clinical trials, abstracts of scientific meetings and reference lists of review articles. SELECTION CRITERIA: We planned to include randomised controlled trials (RCTs), both individually randomised and cluster-RCTs. In the absence of RCTs we planned to include well-designed non-randomised studies (NRS) with a parallel comparison assessing the benefits of any type of health education interventions. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently evaluated whether potentially relevant studies met the inclusion criteria for the review, but none were found. MAIN RESULTS: A comprehensive search of the literature yielded the following results: CENTRAL (1022 references), MEDLINE (2874 references), and Embase (2820 references). After de-duplication, we screened titles and abstracts of 4880 references and excluded 4864 that did not meet the review inclusion criteria. Of the 16 references that potentially met the review inclusion, we excluded all 16 reports after reviewing the full texts. We did not identify any ongoing trials. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is currently an absence of evidence to indicate the effectiveness of health education interventions involving healthcare providers or individuals or both to promote early presentation and referral for women with endometrial cancer symptoms. High-quality RCTs are needed to assess whether health education interventions enhance early presentation and referral. If health education interventions can be shown to reduce treatment delays in endometrial cancer, further studies would be required to determine which interventions are most effective.	2a
23730543	Survival in Sinonasal Melanoma: A Meta-analysis.	UNLABELLED: Sinonasal melanoma is an uncommon tumor which carries a poor prognosis and high rates of local and regional recurrence and distant metastasis. While surgical resection is the mainstay of treatment, the utility of multimodality therapy has not been well studied or established. We sought to better evaluate the optimal treatment modality for sinonasal melanoma. We reviewed 39 case reports involving 423 patients with sinonasal melanoma and present a meta-analysis comparing survival by treatment modality. The two-tailed p-value for survival by treatment modality was determined. The number of primary site/local, regional, and distant recurrences was determined where data was available. There was a nonsignificant increase in survival for patients treated with surgery + radiotherapy versus surgery alone. There was a statistically significant increase in survival for surgery + chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone and versus surgery alone. Patients treated with combined surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy had a statistically shorter survival interval than patients treated with surgery + chemotherapy, which may reflect more advanced disease in patients treated with triple therapy. There was no statistically significant increase in survival found for the addition of radiation to surgery. This meta-analysis demonstrates that multimodality therapy, particularly the addition of chemo-or immunotherapy to surgery, may increase survival in a subset of patients. Radiation therapy did not appear to increase survival. There may be a significant increase in overall survival with combined modality therapy with surgery and chemo/immunotherapy versus single modality therapy. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: III. Grade of recommendation: C.	2a
22079732	Beta-carotene antioxidant use during radiation therapy and prostate cancer outcome in the Physicians' Health Study.	PURPOSE: The safety of antioxidant supplementation during radiation therapy (RT) for cancer is controversial. Antioxidants could potentially counteract the pro-oxidant effects of RT and compromise therapeutic efficacy. We performed a prospective study nested within the Physicians' Health Study (PHS) randomized trial to determine if supplemental antioxidant use during RT for prostate cancer is associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer death or metastases. METHODS AND MATERIALS: PHS participants (383) received RT for prostate cancer while randomized to receive beta-carotene (50 mg on alternate days) or placebo. The primary endpoint was time from RT to lethal prostate cancer, defined as prostate cancer death or bone metastases. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate survival probabilities and the log-rank test to compare groups. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate the effect of beta-carotene compared with that of placebo during RT. RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 10.5 years, there was no significant difference between risk of lethal prostate cancer with the use of beta-carotene during RT compared with that of placebo (hazard ratio = 0.72; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.42-1.24; p = 0.24). After we adjusted for age at RT, prostate-specific antigen serum level, Gleason score, and clinical stage, the difference remained nonsignificant. The 10-year freedom from lethal prostate cancer was 92% (95% CI, 87-95%) in the beta-carotene group and 89% (95% CI, 84-93%) in the placebo group. CONCLUSION: The use of supplemental antioxidant beta-carotene during RT was not associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer death or metastases. This study suggests a lack of harm from supplemental beta-carotene during RT for prostate cancer.	1b
29435025	Bromelain has significant clinical benefits after extraction of the third molar during chemotherapy in patients with hematologic tumor.	The purpose of this study was to investigate the application of bromelain in the treatment of pain, swelling, and limited mouth opening in patients with hematologic tumor after extraction of the third molar during chemotherapy. We recruited 72 patients with hematologic tumor who were treated by oral and maxillofacial surgery in our hospital, and third molar extraction was performed under local anesthesia. After extraction, patients in the control group were treated with cold - hot compress and patients in the experimental group were treated by oral administration of bromelain. One, three, and seven days after extraction, pain, swelling, and mouth opening in the experimental group improved compared to the control group. Additionally, the levels of IL-25 and TNF-alpha in the experimental group were significantly lower than in the control group, suggesting less inflammatory response. On the other hand, EGFR and beta-FGF were significantly higher in the experimental group, supporting the activation of tissue repair pathways. Quality of life scores were significantly better in the experimental group. Overall, bromelain improves the quality of life, alleviates pain, swelling, and mouth opening, and effectively prevent postoperative complications in patients with hematologic tumors after third molar extraction during chemotherapy.	2b
12679797	A phase I trial of immunotherapy with intratumoral adenovirus-interferon-gamma (TG1041) in patients with malignant melanoma.	AIMS: Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) has been shown to upregulate MHC class I and II expression, and to promote generation of specific antitumor immune responses. We hypothesized that intratumoral administration of an IFN-gamma gene transfer vector facilitates its enhanced local production and may activate effector cells locally. We conducted a phase I dose-escalation study of a replication-deficient adenovirus-interferon-gamma construct (TG1041) to determine safety and tolerability of intratumoral administration, in advanced or locally recurrent melanoma. METHODS: Patients were enrolled at four successive dose levels: 10(7) infectious units (iu) (n=3), 10(8) iu (n=3), 10(9) iu (n=3), and 10(10) iu (n=2) per injection per week for 3 weeks. TG1041 was injected in the same tumor nodule weekly in each patient. Safety, toxicity, local and distant tumor responses and biologic correlates were evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 11 patients were enrolled and received the planned three injections per cycle. One patient with stable disease received a second cycle of treatment. A maximum tolerated dose was not reached in this study. No grade 4 toxicities were observed. Two grade 3 toxicities, fever and deep venous thrombosis were observed in one patient. The most frequently reported toxicities were grade 1 pain and redness at the injected site (n=8), and grade 1 fatigue (n=5) patients. Clinical changes observed at the local injected tumor site included erythema (n=5), a minor decrease in size of the injected lesion (n=5) and significant central necrosis by histopathology (n=1). Systemic effects included stable disease in one patient. Correlative studies did not reveal evidence of immunologic activity. CONCLUSION: Weekly intratumoral administration of TG1041 appears to be safe and well tolerated in patients with advanced melanoma.	4
28628843	Preoperative chemotherapy versus chemoradiotherapy in locally advanced adenocarcinomas of the oesophagogastric junction (POET): Long-term results of a controlled randomised trial.	BACKGROUND: Results of the PreOperative therapy in Esophagogastric adenocarcinoma Trial (POET) showed some benefits when including radiotherapy into the preoperative treatment. This article is reporting long-term results of this phase III study. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with locally advanced adenocarcinomas of the oesophagogastric junction (Siewert types I-III) were eligible. Randomisation was done to chemotherapy (group A) or induction chemotherapy and chemoradiotherapy (CRT; group B) followed by surgery. RESULTS: The primary end-point of the study was overall survival at 3 years. The study was closed early after 119 patients having been randomised and were eligible. Local progression-free survival after tumour resection was significantly improved by CRT (hazard ratio [HR] 0.37; 0.16-0.85, p = value 0.01) and 20 versus 12 patients were free of local tumour progression at 5 years (p = 0.03). Although the rate of postoperative in-hospital mortality was somewhat higher with CRT (10.2% versus 3.8%, p = 0.26), more patients were alive at 3 and 5 years after CRT (46.7% and 39.5%) compared with chemotherapy (26.1% and 24.4%). Thus, overall survival showed a trend in favour of preoperative CRT (HR 0.65, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.42-1.01, p = 0.055). CONCLUSION: Although the primary end-point overall survival of the study was not met, our long-term follow-up data suggest a benefit in local progression-free survival when radiotherapy was added to preoperative chemotherapy in patients with locally advanced adenocarcinoma of the oesophagogastric junction.	1b
18059219	Detail histologic analysis of nerve plexus invasion in invasive ductal carcinoma of the pancreas and its prognostic impact.	Nerve plexus invasion is regarded as one of the most important prognostic factors in invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) of the pancreas, though nerve plexus invasion has not been evaluated in terms of prognostic impact on the basis of detailed histologic investigation. The purpose of this study was to precisely examine morphologic characteristics of nerve plexus invasion and analyze its prognostic predictive power compared with the well-known prognostic parameters of pancreatic IDCs. The outcome and histologic features of 75 patients with pancreatic IDC in the pancreas head were investigated, and 422 lesions of nerve plexus invasion were evaluated. Tumor cells invading nerve plexus showed a duct-forming differentiated feature and predominantly existed in the perineurium and perineural space. Multivariate analyses revealed that the important prognostic factors, in addition to invasive tumor size and tumor necrosis, were at long distances from nerve plexus invasion to pancreatic capsule and perineural invasion in nerve plexus invasion.	2b
8214324	The influence of elective neck dissection on neck relapse in NO supraglottic carcinoma.	INTRODUCTION: Mortality due to cancer in patients treated for squamous cell carcinoma of the supraglottic larynx is closely associated with regional relapse in the neck. Controversy exists relative to the most effective way to manage potential cervical metastases. METHODS: The records of 126 patients with carcinoma of the larynx treated between 1975 and 1986 were reviewed. Sixty-three patients with T2-4,NO squamous cell carcinoma of the supraglottic larynx are the subject of this report. Twenty-one patients underwent surgical resection of the primary tumor plus elective neck dissection while 42 patients underwent surgical resection of the primary tumor without neck dissection. Subsequent relapse in the neck was ascertained. RESULTS: The overall neck relapse rate was 31.7%. In patients treated with neck dissection, the relapse rate was 14.3%, while relapse in the patients who did not have neck dissection was 40.5%. Radiation therapy did not seem to make a significant difference in relapse rate in this patient population. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that elective neck dissection decreases the neck relapse rates significantly in patients treated for NO supraglottic carcinoma.	4
27048670	Randomized Trial of Vitamin C/E Complex for Prevention of Radiation-Induced Xerostomia in Patients with Head and Neck Cancer.	OBJECTIVE: The present study was conducted to determine the preventive efficacy of vitamin C/E complex supplementation for radiotherapy (RT)-induced xerostomia in patients with head and neck cancer. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective, double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled study. SETTING: A single tertiary referral institution. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The trial group (n = 25) received antioxidant supplements (100 IU of vitamin E + 500 mg of vitamin C) twice per day during RT, while the control group (n = 20) received an identical placebo. Pre-RT and 1 and 6 months post-RT, patient-reported xerostomia questionnaires, observer-rated xerostomia score, and salivary scintigraphy were serially obtained to compare xerostomia severity between the 2 groups. RESULTS: The trial group showed greater improvements in xerostomia questionnaire and score at 6 months post-RT when compared with those at 1 month post-RT (P = .007 and .008, respectively). In contrast, the control group showed no changes between 1 and 6 months post-RT. By salivary scintigraphy, there was no difference in maximal accumulation or ejection fraction between the 2 groups. However, the trial group maintained significantly better oral indices at the prestimulatory (P = .01) and poststimulatory (P = .009) stages at 1 month post-RT, compared with the control group. At the final follow-up, there was no difference in overall survival and disease-free survival between the 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that short-term supplementation with an antioxidant vitamin E/C complex exerts a protective effect against RT-induced xerostomia.	2b
15947593	Initial experiences with real-time elastography guided biopsies of the prostate.	PURPOSE: Based on our first experiences with real-time elastography in the field of prostate diagnostics we evaluate its usefulness for biopsy guidance for prostate cancer detection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: After imaging with conventional B-mode ultrasound in conjunction with real-time elastography 404 men underwent systematic sextant biopsy. RESULTS: Overall prostate cancer was found in 151 of 404 cases (37.4%). In 127 of 151 cases (84.1%), prostate cancer was detected using real-time elastography as an additional diagnostic feature. CONCLUSIONS: The results show that it is possible to detect prostate cancer with a high degree of sensitivity using real-time elastography in conjunction with conventional diagnostic methods for guided prostate biopsies.	2a
27580185	Clinical Indications for Use of Reflectance Confocal Microscopy for Skin Cancer Diagnosis.	Importance: Reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) improves diagnostic accuracy in skin cancer detection when combined with dermoscopy; however, little evidence has been gathered regarding its real impact on routine clinical workflow, and, to our knowledge, no studies have defined the terms for its optimal application. Objective: To identify lesions on which RCM performs better in terms of diagnostic accuracy and consequently to outline the best indications for use of RCM. Design, Setting, and Participants: Prospectively acquired and evaluated RCM images from consecutive patients with at least 1 clinically and/or dermoscopically equivocal skin lesion referred to RCM imaging, from January 2012 to October 2014, carried out in a tertiary referral academic center. Main Outcomes and Measures: A total of 1279 equivocal skin lesions were sent for RCM imaging. Spearman correlation, univariate, and multivariate regression models were performed to find features significantly correlated with RCM outcome. Results: In a total of 1279 lesions in 1147 patients, RCM sensitivity and specificity were 95.3% and 83.9%, respectively. The number of lesions needed to excise to rule out a melanoma was 2.4. After univariate and multivariate regression analysis, head and neck resulted as the most appropriate body location for confocal examination; RCM showed a high diagnostic accuracy for lesions located on sun-damaged skin (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 2.13; 95% CI, 1.37-3.30; P=.001) and typified by dermoscopic regression (aOR, 2.13; 95% CI, 1.31-3.47; P=.002) or basal-cell carcinoma specific criteria (aOR, 9.35; 95% CI, 1.28-68.58; P=.03). Conclusions and Relevance: Lesions located on the head and neck, damaged by chronic sun-exposure, and dermoscopically typified by regression represent best indications for the use of RCM.	2a
16314626	Phase III randomized trial of cisplatin plus placebo compared with cisplatin plus cetuximab in metastatic/recurrent head and neck cancer: an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group study.	PURPOSE: Therapy of recurrent/metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck results in median progression-free survival (PFS) of 2 months. These cancers are rich in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). We wished to determine whether the addition of cetuximab, which inhibits activation of EGFR, would improve PFS. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with recurrent/metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck were randomly assigned to receive cisplatin every 4 weeks, with weekly cetuximab (arm A) or placebo (arm B). Tumor tissue was assayed for EGFR expression by immunohistochemistry. The primary end point was PFS. Secondary end points of interest were response rate, toxicity, overall survival, and correlation of EGFR with clinical end points. RESULTS: There were 117 analyzable patients enrolled. Median PFS was 2.7 months for arm B and 4.2 months for arm A. The hazard ratio for progression of arm A to arm B was 0.78 (95% CI, 0.54 to 1.12). Median overall survival was 8.0 months for arm B and 9.2 months for arm A (P = .21). The hazard ratio for survival by skin toxicity in cetuximab-treated patients was 0.42 (95% CI, 0.21 to 0.86). Objective response rate was 26% [corrected] for arm A and 10% [corrected] for arm B (P = .03). Enhancement of response was greater for patients with EGFR staining present in less than 80% of cells. CONCLUSION: Addition of cetuximab to cisplatin significantly improves response rate. There was a survival advantage for the development of rash. Progression-free and overall survival were not significantly improved by the addition of cetuximab in this study.	1b
11248167	Melanoma thickness and histology predict sentinel lymph node status.	BACKGROUND: It remains unclear which patients with melanoma will benefit most from lymphatic mapping and sentinel lymphadenectomy. The purpose of this study is to determine whether primary melanoma histopathologic features could be applied to predict sentinel node status. METHODS: One hundred twelve patients underwent sentinel node biopsy between May 1995 and August 1999. Reported histologic features were assessed for predictive value by univariate and multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: The sentinel node was located successfully in 105 of the 112 patients (94%). Twenty-one of these 105 patients (20%) had sentinel nodes that were positive for metastatic disease. Multivariate analyses revealed that tumor thickness greater than 1.5 mm (P = 0.01), ulceration (P <0.01), and lymphovascular invasion (P = 0.05) predicted the presence of micrometastases. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of unfavorable histopathology such as ulceration and lymphovascular invasion may identify a group of patients with thin melanomas who would benefit from sentinel lymphadenectomy.	3b
17327608	Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes predict sentinel lymph node positivity in patients with cutaneous melanoma.	PURPOSE: Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) are considered a manifestation of the host immune response to tumor, but the influence of TILs on outcome remains controversial. Studies evaluating the prognostic significance of TILs were published before routine examination of draining lymph nodes by sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy, the most important predictor of survival in patients with melanoma. The prognostic implications of TILs were re-evaluated in a large group of patients undergoing SLN biopsy at our institution. PATIENTS AND METHODS: All patients who underwent SLN mapping for primary cutaneous melanoma between January 1996 and July 2005 were evaluated. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to assess factors that predict SLN positivity and survival. Factors analyzed included Breslow thickness, ulceration, anatomic site, sex, Clark level, age, mitotic rate, and the presence (brisk or nonbrisk) or absence of TIL. RESULTS: Eight hundred eighty-seven patients underwent SLN mapping, and a SLN was identified in 875 patients (98.8%). The SLN was positive for tumor in 156 patients (17.6%). Multivariate analysis revealed that only Breslow thickness (P < .0001), ulceration (P = .0004), male sex (P = .03), and absent TILs (P = .0003) were independently predictive of the presence of SLN metastases. In melanomas with a brisk TIL infiltrate, the probability of a positive SLN was 3.9% as compared with 26.2% for melanomas in which TILs were absent. TILs were not an independent predictive factor for survival. CONCLUSION: The absence of TILs, together with increasing Breslow thickness, presence of ulceration and male sex, predicts SLN metastasis in patients undergoing SLN biopsy for primary cutaneous melanoma.	2b
12721240	Phase III double-blind study of glutamine versus placebo for the prevention of acute diarrhea in patients receiving pelvic radiation therapy.	PURPOSE: A phase III, randomized, double-blind study was conducted by the North Central Cancer Treatment Group to determine the efficacy and toxicity of oral glutamine for the prevention of acute diarrhea in patients receiving pelvic radiation therapy (RT). PATIENTS AND METHODS: All 129 patients enrolled from 14 institutions between February 1998 and October 1999 were eligible. Patients received 4 g of glutamine or placebo orally, twice a day, beginning with the first or second day of RT and continuing for 2 weeks after RT. During treatment, patients were assessed weekly for toxicity, and a bowel function questionnaire was administered. The primary measures of treatment efficacy were diarrhea levels measured by maximum grade of diarrhea, incidence of diarrhea, and average diarrhea score. After completion of RT, the bowel function questionnaire was administered weekly for 4 weeks and at 12 and 24 months. Toxicity was measured by National Cancer Institute common toxicity criteria. RESULTS: The median age of patients was 69 years (range, 34 to 86 years). The two treatment arms were balanced with respect to all baseline factors. There were no significant differences in toxicity by treatment. Quality-of-life scores and the mean number of problems reported on the bowel function questionnaire were virtually identical for both treatment groups. The incidence of grade 3 or higher diarrhea was 20% for the glutamine arm and 19% for the placebo arm (P =.99). The maximum number of stools per day was 5.1 for the glutamine arm and 5.2 for the placebo arm (P =.99). CONCLUSION: There is no evidence of a beneficial effect of glutamine during pelvic RT.	1b
19777195	Prognostic significance of lymph node metastases in pancreatic head cancer treated with extended lymphadenectomy: not just a matter of numbers.	BACKGROUND: The prognostic significance of variables related to nodal involvement (node status, number of disease-positive nodes [posNn], node ratio [Nr], and site of nodal metastases) in patients with resected pancreatic head cancer remains poorly defined. METHODS: Clinical, operative, and pathologic data, including indexes of the burden and extent of nodal involvement, were analyzed in a consecutive series of 77 patients who underwent resection with extended lymphadenectomy for adenocarcinoma of the pancreatic head. RESULTS: Fifty-nine patients (77%) were found to have lymph node (LN) metastases. Median LN count, posNn, and Nr were 28 (10-54), 4 (1-29), and 14% (2%-55%), respectively. Twenty-six patients (44% of N1) had metastases limited to node level (NL) 1 (i.e., peripancreatic nodes); metastases up to NL2 (nodes along main arteries and hepatic hilum) and NL3 (preaortic nodes) were found in 21 (36%) and 12 (20%) patients, respectively. Interestingly, survival of patients with positive LN limited to NL1 was similar to that of node-negative patients (P = 0.407). posNn, Nr, and NL were all significant predictors of survival (P < 0.015). posNn and Nr proved to be an accurate proxy of NL involvement. The best cutoff of posNn was 2 and of and Nr was 10%. CONCLUSIONS: The level of nodal metastatic spread is a statistically significant prognostic factor in cancer of the pancreatic head. Both posNn and Nr are accurate proxy of NL and may improve patients' risk stratification.	2b
11802046	Elective, therapeutic, and delayed lymph node dissection for malignant melanoma of the head and neck: analysis of 1444 patients from 1970 to 1998.	OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this article is to evaluate the effects on survival, disease-free interval, and recurrence patterns for patients undergoing elective, therapeutic, and delayed lymph node dissection for malignant melanoma of the head and neck. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A retrospective computer-aided analysis was performed comparing 1444 patients treated from 1970 to 1998 at Duke University Medical Center. A total of 446 of the 1444 (32%) of patients with head and neck melanoma underwent some form of lymph node dissection. Survival, disease-free interval, and recurrence rates for patients having 1) no initial lymph node dissection (no LND), 2) elective lymph node dissection (ELND) within 2 months of date of diagnosis, 3) therapeutic lymph node dissection (TLND) for metastatic regional disease at diagnosis, or 4) delayed lymph node dissection (DLND) for patients developing regional lymph node metastasis later than 3 months from the date of diagnosis were compared. RESULTS: A total of 246 patients undergoing ELND demonstrated 11% with occult disease. DLND for regional lymph node recurrence was reported at a median time interval of 1.2 years from diagnosis. Multivariate analysis indicated a significant improvement in survival for DLND when compared with patients undergoing ELND plus sign in circle or TLND (P =.01). Distant metastasis was the site of first recurrence in 12% of patients undergoing no initial LND. Five-year survival after DLND and TLND was 56% and 36%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Patients undergoing DLND had an overall better survival than patients undergoing TLND or ELND with positive nodes. The progression of metastatic disease following regional node disease occurred in 35% to 45% of cases, underscoring the need for effective adjunctive therapy.	3b
21215429	Factors that influence patient enrollment in active surveillance for low-risk prostate cancer.	OBJECTIVES: To learn from patients their rationale for enrollment in active surveillance (AS) for low-risk prostate cancer as an alternative to primary treatment. METHODS: A rank-order survey was designed to assess the relative influence of factors that contributed to the decision to elect AS. The survey was mailed to 185 patients enrolled in AS at our university-based urologic oncology practice. Participants were also asked whether they had been offered AS as an alternative to primary treatment by the urologist who had initially diagnosed their cancer. RESULTS: The survey was returned by 105 (57%) of 185 patients. AS was offered to 38 (36%) of 105 patients by the physician who had made the initial diagnosis. Patients most frequently reported physician influence as the greatest contributor to their decision to elect AS (73%). Patients also cited concerns regarding the potential side effects of incontinence (48%) and erectile dysfunction (44%) associated with therapy as reasons for choosing AS. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present study have shown that patients are heavily influenced by physicians in their decision to elect AS. Notably, the majority of our sampled patients were not offered AS at diagnosis. Evidence has indicated that AS is an appropriate approach for low-risk prostate cancer and should be discussed with patients in this risk category.	3a
27430394	Physical effects of Anma therapy (Japanese massage) for gynecologic cancer survivors: A randomized controlled trial.	OBJECTIVES: Cancer survivors often have physical and psychological complaints after standard cancer treatment. We conducted a randomized control trial to evaluate the physical and psychological/emotional effects of Anma therapy (Japanese massage, AMT) in gynecologic cancer survivors. The primary objective was to verify the effects of 8 consecutive weeks of weekly AMT. The secondary objective was to confirm the immediate effects of single-session AMT. We report here results of the physical effects of AMT. METHODS: Forty participants were randomly allocated to an AMT group that received one 40-min AMT session per week for 8weeks and a no-AMT group. The primary endpoint was severity of subjective physical complaints assessed using a visual analogue scale (VAS). Secondary endpoints were urine and saliva analyses and psychological/emotional questionnaire scores. RESULTS: In the primary analysis, least-squares means (LSM) estimates of VAS score improvement over the 8weeks were -21.5 (95% confidence interval [CI], -30.1 to -12.8, P=0.0017) in the AMT group (n=20) and 0.8 (95%CI, -7.7 to 9.2, P=0.89) in the no-AMT group (n=20). The difference in the LSM estimates between the groups was -22.2 (95%CI, -34.4 to -10.1, P=0.0007). There were significant differences in VAS score and urinary epinephrine between before and after the intervention session, demonstrating the superiority of AMT. CONCLUSIONS: A single AMT session reduces the severity of subjective physical complaints and might inhibit the sympathetic nervous system in gynecologic cancer survivors. Receiving weekly AMT sessions for eight weeks effectively continues to reduce the severity of subjective physical complaints.	1b
22843632	Process and outcomes of a skin protection intervention for young adults.	Efforts to reduce skin cancer risk behaviors using appearance-oriented interventions (e.g. ultraviolet (UV) light photos showing skin damage) or motivational interviewing (MI) have shown promise in recent trials. In the study a randomized 2 (UV photo versus no UV photo) x 2 (MI versus no MI) factorial design with longitudinal follow up was used. Results showed that progression in stage of change (SOC) was significantly more likely in the photo than the education condition. Treatment credibility as rated by participants and counselor perceived positive therapeutic alliance predicted SOC progression. There was also preliminary evidence for differential intervention effectiveness by baseline SOC. The implications are discussed.	1b
19436683	Effects of singing classes on pulmonary function and quality of life of COPD patients.	This study aimed to investigate the effects of weekly singing classes on pulmonary function parameters and quality of life (QoL) of COPD patients. Forty-three patients were randomized to weekly classes of singing practice, or handcraft work. They performed spirometry and completed maximal respiratory pressure measurements, evaluations of dyspnea, and the Saint George's Respiratory Questionnaire, before and after 24 training classes. A functional evaluation, immediately after 10 minutes of singing practice, was also performed at the end of the study. Fifteen subjects completed the study in each group. In comparison to controls the singing group exhibited transitory elevations on the dyspnea Borg scale (p = 0.02), and inspiratory capacity (p = 0.01), and decreases of expiratory reserve volume (p = 0.03), just after a short session of singing. There was a significant difference on changes of maximal expiratory pressures in the comparison between groups at the end of training. While the control group showed deterioration of maximal expiratory pressure, the singing group exhibited a small improvement (p = 0.05). Both groups showed significant improvements of QoL in within group comparisons. We have concluded that singing classes are a well tolerated activity for selected subjects with COPD. Regular practice of singing may improve QoL, and preserve the maximal expiratory pressure of these patients.	1a
28700428	Prospective Evaluation of Lymph Node Processing at Staging Surgery for High-grade Endometrial Cancer.	To determine whether the processing of additional adipose tissue collected during lymph node (LN) dissection results in the identification of additional LNs during endometrial cancer (EC) staging and to determine if the division of LNs into nodal basin-specific specimens has an effect on the number of LNs identified during EC staging. A prospective randomized controlled trial was performed on women with high-grade EC undergoing surgical staging. Subjects were randomized to collection of LNs into nodal basin-specific containers on the randomized side versus simple labeling on the nonrandomized side. The total number of LNs and total number of LNs with metastases on the randomized versus the nonrandomized side were compared. The remaining adipose tissue from each LN specimen was submitted for histologic examination. We analyzed the number of LNs with and without metastases identified from additional adipose tissue. Of 120 consented subjects, 56 had sufficient data for analysis. The additional adipose tissue contained 7.5 additional LNs per patient on average (range: 0-26). In 2/54 total cases (3.7%) and 2/5 cases with nodal metastases (40%), the additional adipose contained LNs with metastases. In both cases, metastases were also detected in grossly identified LN candidates. The mean number of LNs identified was not significantly different based on method of collection (P=0.22). The mean number of LNs containing metastases per side was not significantly different (P=0.58). Processing of adipose tissue does increase the total number of LNs identified, however, it does not influence EC stage. No difference in LN counts was noted with basin-specific collection.	2a
26446299	Cost-benefit of reflectance confocal microscopy in the diagnostic performance of melanoma.	BACKGROUND: The sub-optimal diagnostic accuracy for melanoma leads to excise a high number of benign lesions, with consequent costs. Reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) improves diagnostic specificity, thus possibly inducing a reduction in unnecessary excisions and related costs. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the influence of RCM on number of benign lesions needed to excise (NNE) a melanoma, in term of clinical outcomes and costs per patient. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Skin neoplasms excised by the dermatology public service in the Province of Modena were retrieved form centralized pathology database. Differences in NNE between the territorial service (using dermoscopy only) and the University Hospital (adding also RCM to the patients' workflow) were calculated and cost analysis was performed through a micro-costing approach. RESULTS: A large reduction in benign lesions excised at University Hospital was evident, leading to NNE of 6.25 for University Hospital, compared to 19.41 for Territorial Dermatology. Since 4320 unnecessary excisions can be saved every million inhabitants, an overall yearly saving of over 280,000 Eur can be expected from the use of RCM. CONCLUSIONS: The systematic use of RCM was dramatically affecting the number of benign lesions excised, and this can be translated in a significant cost-benefit advantage.	3a
11948274	Variations in morbidity after radical prostatectomy.	BACKGROUND: Recent studies of surgery for cancer have demonstrated variations in outcomes among hospitals and among surgeons. We sought to examine variations in morbidity after radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer. METHODS: We used the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare linked data base to evaluate health-related outcomes after radical prostatectomy. The rates of postoperative complications, late urinary complications (strictures or fistulas 31 to 365 days after the procedure), and long-term incontinence (more than 1 year after the procedure) were inferred from the Medicare claims records of 11,522 patients who underwent prostatectomy between 1992 and 1996. These rates were analyzed in relation to hospital volume and surgeon volume (the number of procedures performed at individual hospitals and by individual surgeons, respectively). RESULTS: Neither hospital volume nor surgeon volume was significantly associated with surgery-related death. Significant trends in the relation between volume and outcome were observed with respect to postoperative complications and late urinary complications. Postoperative morbidity was lower in very-high-volume hospitals than in low-volume hospitals (27 percent vs. 32 percent, P=0.03) and was also lower when the prostatectomy was performed by very-high-volume surgeons than when it was performed by low-volume surgeons (26 percent vs. 32 percent, P<0.001). The rates of late urinary complications followed a similar pattern. Results for long-term preservation of continence were less clear-cut. In a detailed analysis of the 159 surgeons who had a high or very high volume of procedures, wide surgeon-to-surgeon variations in these clinical outcomes were observed, and they were much greater than would be predicted on the basis of chance or observed variations in the case mix. CONCLUSIONS: In men undergoing prostatectomy, the rates of postoperative and late urinary complications are significantly reduced if the procedure is performed in a high-volume hospital and by a surgeon who performs a high number of such procedures.	2a
28968482	Lymphadenectomy for the management of endometrial cancer.	BACKGROUND: This is an update of a previous Cochrane review published in Issue 1, 2010 and updated in Issue 9, 2015. The role of lymphadenectomy in surgical management of endometrial cancer remains controversial. Lymph node metastases can be found in approximately 10% of women who before surgery are thought to have cancer confined to the womb. Removal of all pelvic and para-aortic lymph nodes (lymphadenectomy) at initial surgery has been widely advocated, and pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy remains part of the FIGO (International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics) staging system for endometrial cancer. This recommendation is based on data from studies that suggested improvement in survival following pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy. However, these studies were not randomised controlled trials (RCTs), and treatment of pelvic lymph nodes may not confer a direct therapeutic benefit, other than allocating women to poorer prognosis groups. Furthermore, the Cochrane review and meta-analysis of RCTs of routine adjuvant radiotherapy to treat possible lymph node metastases in women with early-stage endometrial cancer found no survival advantage. Surgical removal of pelvic and para-aortic lymph nodes has serious potential short-term and long-term sequelae. Therefore, it is important to investigate the clinical value of this treatment. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of lymphadenectomy for the management of endometrial cancer. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and Embase to June 2009 for the original review, updated the search to June 2015 for the last updated version and further extended the search to March 2017 for this version of the review. We also searched registers of clinical trials, abstracts of scientific meetings, and reference lists of included studies, and we contacted experts in the field. SELECTION CRITERIA: RCTs and quasi-RCTs that compared lymphadenectomy versus no lymphadenectomy in adult women diagnosed with endometrial cancer. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. Hazard ratios (HRs) for overall and progression-free survival and risk ratios (RRs) comparing adverse events in women who received lymphadenectomy versus those with no lymphadenectomy were pooled in random-effects meta-analyses. We assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach. MAIN RESULTS: 978 unique references were identified via the search strategy. All but 50 were excluded by title and abstract screening. Three RCTs met the inclusion criteria; for one small RCT, data were insufficient for inclusion in the meta-analysis. The two RCTs included in the analysis randomly assigned 1945 women, reported HRs for survival adjusted for prognostic factors and based on 1851 women and had an overall low risk of bias, as they satisfied four of the assessment criteria. The third study had an overall unclear risk of bias, as information provided was not adequate concerning random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, or completeness of outcome reporting.Results of the meta-analysis remained unchanged from the previous versions of this review and indicated no differences in overall and recurrence-free survival between women who underwent lymphadenectomy and those who did not undergo lymphadenectomy (pooled hazard ratio (HR) 1.07, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.81 to 1.43; HR 1.23, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.58 for overall and recurrence-free survival, respectively) (1851 participants, two studies; moderate-quality evidence).We found no difference in risk of direct surgical morbidity between women who underwent lymphadenectomy and those who did not undergo lymphadenectomy. However, women who underwent lymphadenectomy had a significantly higher risk of surgery-related systemic morbidity and lymphoedema/lymphocyst formation than those who did not undergo lymphadenectomy (RR 3.72, 95% CI 1.04 to 13.27; RR 8.39, 95% CI 4.06 to 17.33 for risk of surgery-related systemic morbidity and lymphoedema/lymphocyst formation, respectively) (1922 participants, two studies; high-quality evidence). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: This review found no evidence that lymphadenectomy decreases risk of death or disease recurrence compared with no lymphadenectomy in women with presumed stage I disease. Evidence on serious adverse events suggests that women who undergo lymphadenectomy are more likely to experience surgery-related systemic morbidity or lymphoedema/lymphocyst formation. Currently, no RCT evidence shows the impact of lymphadenectomy in women with higher-stage disease and in those at high risk of disease recurrence.	1a
18158034	Targeted biopsy of the prostate: the impact of color Doppler imaging and elastography on prostate cancer detection and Gleason score.	OBJECTIVES: To compare detection of prostate cancer and distribution of Gleason scores with gray-scale, color Doppler, and elastographic imaging. METHODS: Prostate biopsy patients were evaluated with gray-scale, color Doppler, and elastographic imaging. Targeted biopsy cores were obtained along with six laterally directed systematic sextant cores. Pathologic results were correlated with imaging findings. RESULTS: Prostate cancer was detected in 60 of 137 patients (43.8%). Cancer was detected in 241 (14%) of 1703 biopsy cores, including 90 (20%) of 448 targeted cores, 106 (13%) of 818 sextant cores, and 45 (10%) of 437 transition zone cores. Sonographic abnormality was associated with cancer: gray-scale odds ratio (OR) = 3.19, P = 0.011; color Doppler OR = 1.86, P = 0.041; elastography OR = 2.53; P = 0.007. Although targeted cores were more likely than sextant cores to detect cancer (OR = 1.82, P = 0.004), no sonographic abnormality was found in 57 (53.8%) of 106 of positive sextant sites. A linear trend for increasing Gleason score was present with gray-scale (P <0.001) imaging, color Doppler imaging (P <0.005), and elastography (P <0.001). Abnormal color flow was strongly associated with Gleason score 8 to 10 lesions but not with lower-grade lesions. Elastography demonstrated a positive association with Gleason scores of 5 to 10. CONCLUSIONS: Targeted cores based on gray-scale, color Doppler, and elastographic imaging are more likely to return positive biopsy results as compared with systematic biopsy cores. Although color Doppler imaging and elastography are encouraging adjuncts to improve cancer detection, targeted biopsy alone is not sufficient to replace the traditional sextant biopsy technique.	2b
21792017	Clinical study on the efficacy of fluvoxamine for psychological distress in gynecologic cancer patients.	BACKGROUND: Diagnosis of cancer causes psychological distress. The present study investigated the safety and efficacy of fluvoxamine therapy in gynecologic cancer patients with either adjustment disorder or major depression after cancer was diagnosed. METHODS: Screening with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) was conducted at least 2 weeks after notification of the diagnosis of cancer in 214 gynecologic cancer patients hospitalized between January 2007 and December 2008. The HADS cutoff score was set at 11 points or greater. Informed consent to the study was obtained from 10 patients, and fluvoxamine was administered for 8 weeks. As primary end points, the safety and efficacy of fluvoxamine were evaluated using the HADS and the SF-36. As a secondary end point, the Clinical Global Impression was determined. RESULTS: The total HADS score, the anxiety score, and the depression score were significantly reduced after 6, 4, and 6 weeks of treatment, respectively. The SF-36 revealed significant improvement in vitality, mental health, and role (emotional) after 8 weeks of treatment. In the 5 patients with adjustment disorder, only the HADS anxiety score was significantly reduced after 4 weeks. In the 5 patients with major depression, the total HADS score, the anxiety score, and the depression score were significantly reduced after 6, 8, and 6 weeks, respectively. According to the SF-36, the adjustment-disorder groups showed significant improvement in mental health after 8 weeks of treatment, whereas the major-depression group showed significant improvement in vitality and role (emotional) after 8 weeks. No adverse events occurred in any subject. Assessment of the Clinical Global Impression suggested that fluvoxamine improved psychological distress in all 10 subjects. CONCLUSIONS: The present findings suggest that fluvoxamine is useful for alleviating psychological distress, including adjustment disorder and major depression, in gynecologic cancer patients. Management of psychological distress after diagnosis of cancer is important.	3a
9724997	Cervical lymph-node metastasis from cutaneous melanoma of the head and neck: a search for prognostic factors.	AIMS: To identify prognostic factors determining overall survival in patients with surgically treated neck node metastases of cutaneous melanoma. METHODS: A retrospective study was carried out in 70 patients who were surgically treated with curative intent for cervical lymph-node metastasis from cutaneous head and neck melanoma at our institution between 1960 and 1986. RESULTS: Median follow-up of the 14 patients still alive was 10 years. Of the 70 patients, 64 underwent a radical neck dissection, four a modified radical neck dissection and two a postero-lateral neck dissection. In 63 patients, the node dissection was for palpable involved nodes and in seven for microscopic disease. Survivals after 5 and 10 years were 23% (SE 5%) and 20% (SE 5%), respectively. Five-year survival was 62% (SE 17%) for patients with a melanoma less than 1.5 mm thick and 16% for lesions thicker than 1.5 mm. A regional recurrence in the neck occurred in 16 (23%) patients, of whom 14 were found also to have distant metastases. All patients with regional recurrence died from disease. CONCLUSIONS: Of the 15 patient-, tumour- and treatment-related factors tested, only the Breslow thickness of the primary lesion carried prognostic significance for survival (Bonferroni corrected P-value: 0.026).	3b
18187997	Is PET superior to MRI in the pretherapeutic evaluation of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma?	OBJECTIVES: This study was designed to compare the effectiveness of positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the pretherapeutic staging of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the head and neck. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study included 34 consecutive patients (27 males, 7 females; mean age 61 years; range 42 to 82 years) with SCC of the head and neck. All the patients underwent whole body [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET and MRI scans for pretherapeutic evaluation. Diagnoses were confirmed by histopathologic examination of endoscopic biopsy specimens. RESULTS: The sites of the primary tumors were the oropharynx (n=15, 44%), larynx (n=10, 29%), hypopharynx (n=8, 24%), and nasopharynx (n=1, 3%). Surgery was the treatment of choice in 20 patients (59%), including 23 neck dissections. Fourteen patients (41%) were treated with radiochemotherapy. Both PET and MRI were able to detect the primary tumor in 33 cases (97%). In two patients (6%), PET was able to detect distant metastases in the lung and iliac bone, all of which were confirmed by biopsies. Seven neck specimens (30%) showed lymph node metastasis. Sensitivity and specificity rates for detection of lymph node metastasis were 100% and 87.5% for PET, and 85.7% and 87.5% for MRI, respectively. CONCLUSION: Although PET seems to be superior to MRI in detecting nodal disease and distant metastases, it is still early to recommend it as a primary tool for pretherapeutic evaluation of head and neck cancers due to its limited availability and higher cost.	4
18425927	Non-pharmacological interventions for breathlessness in advanced stages of malignant and non-malignant diseases.	BACKGROUND: Breathlessness is a common and distressing symptom in the advanced stages of malignant and non-malignant diseases. Appropriate management requires both pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions. OBJECTIVES: The primary objective was to determine the effectiveness of non-pharmacological and non-invasive interventions to relieve breathlessness in participants suffering from the five most common conditions causing breathlessness in advanced disease. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the following databases: The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, British Nursing Index, PsycINFO, Science Citation Index Expanded, AMED, The Cochrane Pain, Palliative and Supportive Care Trials Register, The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness in June 2007. We also searched various websites and reference lists of relevant articles and textbooks. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled and controlled clinical trials assessing the effects of non-pharmacological and non-invasive interventions to relieve breathlessness in participants described as suffering from breathlessness due to advanced stages of cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), interstitial lung disease, chronic heart failure or motor neurone disease. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed relevant studies for inclusion. Data extraction and quality assessment was performed by three review authors and checked by two other review authors. Meta-analysis was not attempted due to heterogeneity of studies. MAIN RESULTS: Forty-seven studies were included (2532 participants) and categorised as follows: single component interventions with subcategories of walking aids (n = 7), distractive auditory stimuli (music) (n = 6), chest wall vibration (CWV, n = 5), acupuncture/acupressure (n = 5), relaxation (n = 4), neuro-electrical muscle stimulation (NMES, n = 3) and fan (n = 2). Multi-component interventions were categorised in to counselling and support (n = 5), breathing training (n = 3), counselling and support with breathing-relaxation training (n = 2), case management (n = 2) and psychotherapy (n = 2). There was a high strength of evidence that NMES and CWV could relieve breathlessness and moderate strength for the use of walking aids and breathing training. There is a low strength of evidence that acupuncture/acupressure is helpful. There is not enough data to judge the evidence for distractive auditory stimuli (music), relaxation, fan, counselling and support, counselling and support with breathing-relaxation training, case management and psychotherapy. Most studies have been conducted in COPD patients, only a few studies included participants with other conditions. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Breathing training, walking aids, NMES and CWV appear to be effective non-pharmacological interventions for relieving breathlessness in advanced stages of disease.	1a
20839060	Sentinel node dissection delays recurrence and prolongs melanoma-related survival: an analysis of 673 patients from a single center with long-term follow-up.	BACKGROUND: The status of the sentinel lymph node is an important predictor for survival in melanoma patients, but it is still unclear if early removal of micrometastases by sentinel lymph node dissection (SLND) alters survival. A large series of melanoma patients from a single center with long-term follow-up was analyzed with regard to a possible effect of SLND on the prognosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 673 consecutive melanoma patients were assessed treated in our center either without SLND (377 patients, pre-SLN group, between January 1995 and March 2000) or with SLND (296 patients, SLN group, between April 2000 and March 2003). The median follow-up was 64.0 months in the pre-SLN and 72.5 months in the SLN group. RESULTS: The pre-SLN group and SLN group did not differ significantly with regard to characteristics of the primary melanoma thickness and ulceration, sex, and age. Kaplan-Meier analyses showed a significantly better recurrence-free survival (P < .001), distant metastases free survival (P = .006), and overall survival (P = .049) for patients of the SLN group; the 5-year melanoma-specific survival rates were 80.3% in pre-SLN patients and 84.8% in SLN patients. Initial metastases in the in-transit region and distant locations were of similar frequency in the pre-SLN and SLN groups (P = .191 and P = .959, respectively), but initial regional lymph node metastases were significantly more frequent in the pre-SLN group (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Our data point toward a subgroup of melanoma patients who might have a prognostic benefit from SLN.	2b
10023567	[Early and late treatment of iatrogenic injection damage].	Extravasation injuries can result in extensive soft-tissue defects. On the cellular level there are five different pathophysiological mechanisms. Early treatment (surgical removal of the extravasated material within 24 h) and late treatment (debridement and coverage) are different. Thirty-two patients who suffered a significant extravasation were treated surgically by the Department of Plastic Surgery between 1989 and 1997. In 8 patients, referred within the first 24 h, the extravasated material could be removed by saline flushout. None of these patients developed soft-tissue defects or skin necrosis. The other 24 patients were referred late (mean 19 days after the injury). Patients with defects of the dorsum of the hand or cubital fossa area who underwent debridement, temporary wound coverage and skin grafting (n = 11) presented complete healing 52 days after the referral. Defects of the same regions covered by a flap after debridement (n = 6) healed within 14 days. The healing time of defects of the forearm (n = 2) and dorsum of the foot (n = 5) was a mean of 15 days after skin grafting. Cytotoxic and osmotically active substances should be removed by saline flushout within 24 h. In defects of the dorsum of the hand and cubital fossa, early debridement and coverage with an adequate flap should be performed.	4
6793277	Methods to assess breathlessness in healthy subjects: a critical evaluation and application to analyse the acute effects of diazepam and promethazine on breathlessness induced by exercise or by exposure to raised levels of carbon dioxide.	1. Methods were devised and evaluated for inducing breathlessness by submaximal graded exercise in healthy subjects while objective measurements of cardiorespiratory function were made. Breathlessness was assessed with serial visual analogue scales (VAS), but with various measures to enhance repeatability. 2. A high level of reproducibility was obtained in spite of the subjective nature of the assessment. Individual responses were described by the relationship between breathlessness and ventilation. The sensitivity of the method was demonstrated by the use of inspiratory resistances which disturbed this relationship and caused greater breathlessness for a given level of ventilation. 3. These methods were applied to six healthy subjects to analyse the effects of acute doses of diazepam and promethazine on breathlessness induced by graded exercise or by rebreathing carbon dioxide in a double-blind study. 4. During exercise, diazepam and promethazine did not reduce breathlessness, although there was a minor trend with promethazine. During exposure to elevated levels of carbon dioxide, diazepam and promethazine had no effect on breathlessness. Diazepam and promethazine produced similar levels of sedation, but neither drug had significant effects on the ventilatory response to carbon dioxide. These preliminary findings contrast with those reported for chronic diazepam in 'pink puffers'. 5. Raised levels of carbon dioxide caused greater breathlessness in relation to ventilation than did exercise.	1b
25429434	Droperidol for treatment of nausea and vomiting in palliative care patients.	"BACKGROUND: This is an updated version of the original Cochrane review published in Issue 10, 2010, on droperidol for the treatment of nausea and vomiting in palliative care patients. Nausea and vomiting are common symptoms in patients with terminal illness and can be very unpleasant and distressing. There are several different types of antiemetic treatments that can be used to control these symptoms. Droperidol is an antipsychotic drug and has been used and studied as an antiemetic in the management of postoperative and chemotherapy nausea and vomiting. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy and adverse events (both minor and serious) associated with the use of droperidol for the treatment of nausea and vomiting in palliative care patients. SEARCH METHODS: We searched electronic databases including CENTRAL, MEDLINE (1950-), EMBASE (1980-), CINAHL (1981-) and AMED (1985-), using relevant search terms and synonyms. The basic search strategy was (""droperidol"" OR ""butyrophenone"") AND (""nausea"" OR ""vomiting""), modified for each database. We updated the search on 2 December 2009. We performed updated searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL and AMED 2009 to 2013 on 19 November 2013 and of CINAHL on 20 November 2013. We also searched trial registers (metaRegister of controlled trials (www.controlled-trials.com/mrct), clinicaltrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov) and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (http://apps.who.int/trialsearch/)) on 22 November 2013, using the keyword ""droperidol"". SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of droperidol for the treatment of nausea or vomiting, or both, in adults receiving palliative care or suffering from an incurable progressive medical condition. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We judged the potential relevance of studies based on their titles and abstracts, and obtained studies that we anticipated might meet the inclusion criteria. Two review authors independently reviewed the abstracts for the initial review and four review authors reviewed the abstracts for the update to assess suitability for inclusion. We discussed discrepancies to achieve consensus. MAIN RESULTS: The 2010 search strategy identified 1664 abstracts (and 827 duplicates) of which we obtained 23 studies in full as potentially meeting the inclusion criteria. On review of the full papers, we identified no studies that met the inclusion criteria.The updated searches carried out in November 2013 identified 304 abstracts (261 excluding duplicates) of which we obtained 18 references in full as potentially meeting the inclusion criteria. On review of the full papers, we identified no studies that met the inclusion criteria, therefore there were no included studies in this review.We found no registered trials of droperidol for the management of nausea or vomiting in palliative care. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Since first publication of this review, no new studies were found. There is insufficient evidence to advise on the use of droperidol for the management of nausea and vomiting in palliative care. Studies of antiemetics in palliative care settings are needed to identify which agents are most effective, with minimum side effects."	1a
19011184	Role of PET in the initial staging of cutaneous malignant melanoma: systematic review.	PURPOSE: To calculate summary estimates of the diagnostic performance of fluorine 18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomographic (PET) imaging in the initial staging of cutaneous malignant melanoma (CMM), following the new American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging classification on per-patient and per-lesion bases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews databases, and reference lists of reviews and included papers were searched, without any language restrictions, for relevant articles published before March 2007. Two reviewers independently assessed study eligibility and methodologic quality by using the quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies checklist. A pooled random effect was estimated and a fixed coefficient regression model was used to explore the existing heterogeneity. RESULTS: Twenty-eight studies involving 2905 patients met the inclusion criteria. The pooled estimates of FDG PET for the detection of metastasis in the initial staging of CMM were sensitivity, 83% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 81%, 84%); specificity, 85% (95% CI: 83%, 87%); positive likelihood ratio (LR), 4.56 (95% CI: 3.12, 6.64); negative LR, 0.27 (95% CI: 0.18, 0.40); and diagnostic odds ratio, 19.8 (95% CI: 10.8, 36.4). Results from eight studies suggested that FDG PET was associated with 33% disease management changes (range, 15%-64%). CONCLUSION: There is good preliminary evidence that FDG PET is useful for the initial staging of patients with CMM, especially as adjunctive role in AJCC stages III and IV, to help detect deep soft-tissue, lymph node, and visceral metastases. FDG PET-computed tomographic imaging seemed to be more precise than PET alone, as suggested by four eligible studies. Further evaluation by using a well-designed prospective study, with clinical outcome-focused measures and cost effectiveness analysis, is needed to clarify the appropriate role of FDG PET in CMM staging.

21705947	Prognostic implications of lymph node metastases in carcinoma of the body and tail of the pancreas.	OBJECTIVE: The current classification of pancreatic cancer is based only on anatomic location of metastatic lymph nodes (LNs). On the other hand, the number of metastatic LNs has been used in staging of colorectal, esophageal, and gastric cancers. The aim of this study was to assess the prognostic impact of the number or ratio of the metastatic LNs in pancreatic body and tail carcinoma. METHODS: Eighty-five patients with pancreatic body and tail adenocarcinoma who underwent pancreatectomy were included. Location, number, ratio of metastatic LNs, and the survival of patients were analyzed. RESULTS: Forty patients with LN metastasis had poor prognosis (P = 0.007). The prognoses of patients with 5 or more metastatic LNs were poorer than those with less than 5 metastatic LNs (P = 0.046), and patients with a metastatic LN ratio of 0.2 or more had the worst prognosis. Multivariate analysis revealed that 5 or more metastatic LNs and metastatic LN ratio of 0.2 or more were independent prognostic factors for survival (P = 0.0015 and P = 0.014, respectively). CONCLUSION: These results indicate that the number and the ratio of metastatic LNs can be used to predict poor patient survival and as a staging strategy.	2b
30673873	Mistletoe in oncological treatment: a systematic review : Part 1: survival and safety.	"PURPOSE: Mistletoe treatment of cancer patients is discussed highly controversial in the scientific literature. Aim of this systematic review is to give an extensive overview about current state of research concerning mistletoe therapy of oncologic patients regarding survival, quality of life and safety. METHODS: In September and October 2017 Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), PsycINFO, CINAHL and ""Science Citation Index Expanded"" (Web of Science) were systematically searched. RESULTS: The search strategy identified 3647 hits and 28 publications with 2639 patients were finally included in this review. Mistletoe was used in bladder cancer, breast cancer, other gynecological cancers (cervical cancer, corpus uteri cancer, and ovarian cancer), colorectal cancer, other gastrointestinal cancer (gastric cancer and pancreatic cancer), glioma, head and neck cancer, lung cancer, melanoma and osteosarcoma. In nearly all studies, mistletoe was added to a conventional therapy. Patient relevant endpoints were overall survival (14 studies, n = 1054), progression- or disease-free survival or tumor response (10 studies, n = 1091). Most studies did not show any effect of mistletoe on survival. Especially high quality studies do not show any benefit. CONCLUSIONS: With respect to survival, a thorough review of the literature does not provide any indication to prescribe mistletoe to patients with cancer."	1a
15738542	Multicenter randomized phase II study of two schedules of docetaxel, estramustine, and prednisone versus mitoxantrone plus prednisone in patients with metastatic hormone-refractory prostate cancer.	PURPOSE: Mitoxantrone-corticosteroid is currently the standard palliative treatment in hormone-refractory prostate cancer (HRPC) patients. Recent clinical trials documented the high activity of the docetaxel-estramustine combination. We conducted a randomized phase II study to evaluate prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response (primary end point) and safety of two docetaxel-estramustine-prednisone (DEP) regimens and mitoxantrone-prednisone (MP). PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred thirty metastatic HRPC patients were randomly assigned to receive docetaxel (70 mg/m2 on day 2 or 35 mg/m2 on days 2 and 9 of each 21-day cycle) and estramustine (280 mg p.o. tid on days 1 through 5 and 8 through 12) or mitoxantrone 12 mg/m2 every 3 weeks; all patients received prednisone (10 mg daily). RESULTS: One hundred twenty-seven patients were assessable for PSA response and safety. A > or = 50% PSA decline was found in a greater percentage of patients in the docetaxel arms (67% and 63%) compared with MP (18%; P = .0001). Median time to PSA progression was five times longer with DEP than with MP (8.8 and 9.3 v 1.7 months, respectively; P = .000001). Overall survival was better in the docetaxel arms (18.6 and 18.4 months) compared with the MP arm (13.4 months), but not significantly so (P = .3). Crossover rates differed significantly among treatment arms (16%, 10%, and 48% in arms A, B, and C, respectively; P = .00001). Treatment-related toxicities were mild and mainly hematologic. CONCLUSION: The results of this randomized phase II study showed significantly higher PSA decline < or = 50% and longer times to progression in HRPC patients receiving DEP-based chemotherapy than MP, and that DEP could be proposed in this setting.	1a
27225535	Diagnostic workup for postmenopausal bleeding: a randomised controlled trial.	OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of hysteroscopy for the detection and treatment of endometrial polyps versus expectant management in women with postmenopausal bleeding (PMB), a thickened endometrium and benign endometrial sampling. DESIGN: Multicentre, randomised controlled trial. SETTING: Three academic hospitals and nine non-academic teaching hospitals in the Netherlands. POPULATION: Women with PMB, an endometrial thickness >4 mm and benign result from endometrial sampling. METHODS: Women were randomised to either further diagnostic workup by hysteroscopy (preceded by saline infusion sonography) or expectant management. MAIN OUTCOMES: The primary outcome measure was recurrence of PMB within a year after randomisation. Secondary outcome measures were time to recurrent bleeding and recurrent bleeding after more than 1 year. In the hysteroscopy group, the presence of polyps and the results of their histology were registered. RESULTS: Between January 2010 and October 2013, 200 women were randomised; 98 to hysteroscopy and 102 to expectant management. Within 1 year a total of 15 women (15.3%) in the hysteroscopy group experienced recurrent bleeding, versus 18 (18.0%) in the expectant management group (relative risk 0.85 (95% CI 0.46-1.59). In the hysteroscopy group, 50/98 (51%) polyps were diagnosed of which 6/98 (6%) showed evidence of endometrial (pre)malignancy; final pathology results after hysterectomy showed three women with hyperplasia with atypia and three women with endometrial cancer. CONCLUSION: In women with PMB, a thickened endometrium and benign endometrial sampling, operative hysteroscopy does not reduce recurrent bleeding. Hysteroscopy detected focal endometrial (pre)malignancy in 6% of women who had benign endometrial sampling. This finding indicates that in these women, further diagnostic workup is warranted to detect focal (pre)malignancies, missed by blind endometrial sampling. TWEETABLE ABSTRACT: In women with PMB, hysteroscopy does not reduce recurrent bleeding but is warranted to detect focal malignancy.	2a
29369119	Disease-Free and Survival Outcomes for Total Laparoscopic Hysterectomy Compared With Total Abdominal Hysterectomy in Early-Stage Endometrial Carcinoma: A Meta-analysis.	OBJECTIVES: Laparoscopic hysterectomy is currently offered to a large number of patients, and assessing the noninferiority to abdominal hysterectomy with respect to clinical outcomes is key. We examine rates of recurrence, disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival, and surgical complications of laparoscopic compared with abdominal hysterectomy for the treatment of early-stage endometrial cancer. METHODS: Electronic databases were systematically searched to identify relevant studies, and patient characteristics and clinical outcomes extracted. The primary outcome was 3-year DFS, and estimates were pooled using an inverse-variance weighted meta-analysis. RESULTS: Nine studies (4405 patients) were identified in which DFS was reported in 5 studies. The difference in 3-year DFS was 1.44% (95% confidence interval [CI], -0.65% to 3.53%) in favor of total abdominal hysterectomy, consistent with a noninferiority margin of 5%. Differences in DFS (hazard ratio, 1.10; 95% CI, 0.92-1.32), overall survival (hazard ratio, 1.16; 95% CI, 0.81-1.66), and local recurrence (difference, 0.42%; 95% CI, -0.41% to 1.25%) were not significant. Rates of intraoperative complications showed no difference (0.5%; 95% CI, -1.1% to 2.0%) based on 7 studies. There was a significant reduction in postoperative complications with the laparoscopic procedure (-6.83%; 95% CI, -9.19% to -4.47%). CONCLUSIONS: Noninferiority of laparoscopy was demonstrated on clinical outcomes and was associated with a reduction in postoperative complications. These results support continued treatment by laparoscopic hysterectomy for early-stage endometrial cancer.	1a
29505525	Survival benefits of pelvic lymphadenectomy versus pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy in patients with endometrial cancer: A meta-analysis.	BACKGROUND: Despite that pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy (PPaLND) is recommended as part of accurate surgical staging by International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) in endometrial cancer, the impact of para-aortic lymphadenectomy on survival remains controversial. The aim of this work is to evaluate the survival benefits or risks in endometrial cancer patients who underwent surgical staging with or without para-aortic lymphadenectomy using meta-analysis. METHODS: Literature search was undertaken using PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases for relevant articles published between January 1, 1990, and January 1, 2017, without language restriction. The primary outcome was overall survival (OS); progression-free survival (PFS)/recurrence-free survival (RFS)/disease-free survival (DFS)/disease-related survival (DRS) was also analyzed. Subgroup analysis and sensitivity analysis were conducted to investigate the source of heterogeneity. Quality assessments were performed by Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale (NOS). Publication bias was evaluated by using Begg and Egger tests. The hazard ratio (HR) was pooled with random-effects or fixed-effects model as appropriate. RESULTS: Eight studies with a total of 2793 patients were included. OS was significantly longer in PPaLND group than in pelvic lymphadenectomy (PLND) group for patients with endometrial cancer [HR 0.68; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.55-0.84, P < .001, I = 12.2%]. Subgroup analysis by recurrence risk explored the same association in patients at intermediate- or high-risk (HR 0.52; 95% CI 0.39-0.69, P < .001, I = 41.4%), but not for low-risk patients (HR 0.48; 95% CI 0.21-1.08, P = .077, I = 0). PPaLND with systematic resection of all para-aortic nodes up to renal vein also improved PFS/RFS/DFS/DRS, compared with PLND (HR 0.52, 95% CI 0.37-0.72, P < .001, I = 0). No publication bias was observed among included studies. CONCLUSION: PPaLND is associated with favorable survival outcomes in endometrial cancer patients with intermediate- or high-risk of recurrence compared with PLND, particularly with regards to OS. PPaLND with systematic resection of all para-aortic nodes up to renal vein also improve PFS compared with PLND. Further large-scale randomized clinical trials are required to validate our findings.	3a
25952979	First interim analysis of a randomised trial of whole brain radiotherapy in melanoma brain metastases confirms high data quality.	BACKGROUND: Brain metastases are a common cause of death in patients with melanoma. The role of adjuvant whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) following local treatment of intracranial melanoma metastases is controversial. The Australian and New Zealand Melanoma Trials Group (ANZMTG) and the Trans-Tasman Radiation Oncology Group (TROG) are leading the first ever single histology randomised trial investigating this question. The primary endpoint is distant intracranial failure on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) within twelve months of randomisation. The first planned interim analysis was performed twelve months after randomisation of the 100(th) patient. The analysis was an opportunity to review completeness of the trial data to date. METHODS: All data received up to the end of twelve months after randomisation of the 100th patient was reviewed. RESULTS: Review of pathology reports confirmed that all 100 patients had stage IV melanoma and were appropriately entered into the study. Of the 47 distant intracranial events, 34 occurred in isolation (i.e. only distant failure was identified), whilst 13 were accompanied by local failure. Data review showed compliance with the protocol mandated MRI schedule and accuracy of intracranial failure reporting was very high. The Quality of Life (QoL) component of the study achieved a 91% completion rate. For the neurocognitive function (NCF) assessments, a high completion rate was maintained throughout the 12 month period. Where assessments were not performed at expected time points, valid reasons were noted. Radiotherapy quality was high. Of 50 patients who received WBRT, 32 were reviewed as per protocol design and there was only one major variation out of 308 data points reviewed (0.3%). There were minimal trial related adverse events (AEs) and no serious adverse events (SAEs). Pre-specified protocol stopping rules were not met. CONCLUSIONS: The Data Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) recommended the trial continue recruitment after reviewing the unblinded data. The data provision and quality to date indicates that a reliable outcome will be obtained when the final analysis is performed. Accrual is ongoing with 156 out of 200 patients randomised to date (26(th) November 2014).	1b
17219277	Impact of lymph node micrometastasis in patients with pancreatic head cancer.	PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the clinical significance of nodal micrometastasis in patients who underwent a curative operation for pancreatic cancer. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Fifty-eight patients underwent a macroscopically curative resection with extended lymph node dissection for pancreatic cancer. The total number of resected lymph nodes was 1,058, and 944 histologically negative lymph nodes were subjected to immunohistochemical staining to detect occult micrometastases. RESULTS: Nodal micrometastases were detected immunohistochemically in 147 out of 944 resected histologically negative lymph nodes (15.6%). Forty-four of all 58 patients (75.9%) and 13 of the 23 histologically node-negative patients (56.5%) had nodal micrometastases. Nodal micrometastases existed in the N1 lymph node area most frequently, followed by the N2 and N3 lymph node areas. The distribution was similar to that of histologically metastatic lymph nodes. Ten out of 16 patients (62.5%) with histological N1, and 5 out of 16 patients (31.3%) with histological N2 had nodal micrometastases beyond the histological lymph node status. Three and 5-year survival rates of pN0 patients without lymph node nodal micrometastases were both 60.0%, while those with nodal micrometastases were 19.2% and 0%, respectively. There was statistically significant difference between the both groups (P = 0.041). CONCLUSIONS: Nodal micrometastasis in pancreatic cancer existed in wider and more distant areas than histological lymph node status, and it was an unfavorable predictive factor, even in N0 patients.	4
17406358	Systematic review, including meta-analyses, on the management of locally advanced pancreatic cancer using radiation/combined modality therapy.	There is no consensus on the management of locally advanced pancreatic cancer, with either chemotherapy or combined modality approaches being employed (Maheshwari and Moser, 2005). No published meta-analysis (Fung et al, 2003; Banu et al, 2005; Liang, 2005; Bria et al, 2006; Milella et al, 2006) has included randomised controlled trials employing radiation therapy. The aim of this systematic review was to compare the following: (i) chemoradiation followed by chemotherapy (combined modality therapy) vs best supportive care (ii) radiotherapy vs chemoradiation (iii) radiotherapy vs combined modality therapy (iv) chemotherapy vs combined modality therapy (v) 5FU-based combined modality treatment vs another-agent-based combined modality therapy. Relevant randomised controlled trials were identified by searching databases, trial registers and conference proceedings. The primary end point was overall survival and secondary end points were progression-free survival/time-to-progression, response rate and adverse events. Survival data were summarised using hazard ratio (HR) and response-rate/adverse-event data with relative risk. Eleven trials involving 794 patients met the inclusion criteria. Length of survival with chemoradiation was increased compared with radiotherapy alone (two trials, 168 patients, HR 0.69; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.51-0.94), but chemoradiation followed by chemotherapy did not lead to a survival advantage over chemotherapy alone (two trials, 134 patients, HR 0.79; CI 0.32-1.95). Meta-analyses could not be performed for the other comparisons. A survival benefit was demonstrated for chemoradiation over radiotherapy alone. Chemoradiation followed by chemotherapy did not demonstrate any survival advantage over chemotherapy alone, but important clinical differences cannot be ruled out due to the wide CI.	1a
16094113	Supraglottic laryngeal cancer: analysis of treatment results.	"OBJECTIVE: This study reports the results of treatment for supraglottic laryngeal cancer with nine different treatment modalities with long-term follow-up. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective study of 653 patients with supraglottic laryngeal squamous cell cancer treated from April 1955 to January 1999. METHODS: The study population included previously untreated patients with cancer of the supraglottic larynx treated with curative intent by one of nine treatment modalities and who were eligible for 5-year follow-up. The treatment modalities included subtotal supraglottic laryngectomy (SSL), SSL with neck dissection (SSL/ND), total laryngectomy (TL), TL/ND, radiation therapy (RT), SSL/RT, SSL/ND/RT, TL/RT, and TL/ND/RT. Multiple diagnostic, treatment, and follow-up parameters were studied using standard statistical analysis to determine significance. RESULTS: None of the nine treatment modalities produced a survival advantage, either overall or within the stages. Overall disease specific survival (DSS) by treatment modality included SSL 88.9%, SSL/ND 75.8%, TL 83.3%, TL/ND 66.7%, RT 47.2%, SSL/RT 68.9%, SSL/ND/RT 68.1%, TL/RT 59.3%, and TL/ND/RT 46.7%. Improved DSS and cumulative disease specific survival rates were associated with patients under the age of 65 years (P = .0001), early stage disease, N0 disease (P = .0001), clear resection margins (P = .0094), and no recurrence (P = .0001). Posttreatment function showed that 90% of patients were functional in everyday life, 90.7% were eating satisfactorily, 91.4% were breathing naturally, and 83% of SSL patients, 85.7% of RT patients, and 52.8% of TL patients had ""good"" voices. Laryngeal preservation was accomplished in 86.1% of SSL patients and 72.7% of RT patients (P = .0190). CONCLUSIONS: No treatment modality produced a survival advantage. Because SSL produced the best rate of laryngeal preservation, we recommend its use in treating the primary in eligible patients. The importance of clear resection margins is stressed. Patients with N+ disease should have the neck treated. Patients with N0 disease may be observed safely with no loss of survival advantage. Because of the pattern of recurrence and the high rates of distant metastasis and second primary cancers, follow-up for a period of not less than 8 years is recommended."	4
21708854	Transdermal opioids as front line treatment of moderate to severe cancer pain: a systemic review.	BACKGROUND: To assess the role of transdermal opioids as a front-line approach to moderate to severe cancer pain. METHODS: A systematic review of the literature was performed by two authors. An analysis of the level of evidence and risk/benefit ratio was performed for all of the selected trials. A combined analysis of the included studies to assess the level of evidence, risk/benefit ratio and strength of the recommendations was performed to determine the place of transdermal opioids in the treatment of cancer when compared with oral morphine. RESULTS: Thirteen papers were included in the analysis. The level of evidence was considered low for transdermal opioids (without distinction between transdermal fentanyl and transdermal buprenorphine) or transdermal fentanyl, and very low for transdermal buprenorphine. The risk/benefit ratio was considered uncertain for both transdermal opioids (fentanyl and buprenorphine) considered together and transdermal fentanyl or buprenorphine alone. The strength of the final recommendations (using the GRADE system) was weak negative for transdermal opioids (transdermal fentanyl plus transdermal buprenorphine) and transdermal fentanyl, and strong negative for transdermal buprenorphine. CONCLUSIONS: The use of slow release oral morphine probably remains the preferred approach for these patients, with the use of transdermal opioids to be reserved for selected patients.	1b
27549602	A Web-Based Intervention to Reduce Indoor Tanning Motivations in Adolescents: a Randomized Controlled Trial.	Youthful indoor tanning as few as ten sessions can increase the risk of melanoma by two to four times with each additional session adding another 2 % to the risk. Recent research estimates that indoor tanning can be linked to approximately 450,000 cases of skin cancer annually in the USA, Europe, and Australia. Despite these risks, indoor tanning remains popular with adolescents. This study tested the efficacy of a web-based skin cancer prevention intervention designed to reduce indoor tanning motivations in adolescent females. A nationally representative sample of 443 female teens was enrolled from an online panel into a two-arm, parallel group design, randomized controlled trial. Treatment participants received an appearance-focused intervention grounded in established health behavior change models. Controls viewed a teen alcohol prevention website. Outcome variables included willingness and intentions to indoor tan, willingness to sunless tan, and measures of indoor tanning attitudes and beliefs. The intervention decreased willingness and intentions to indoor tan and increased sunless tanning willingness relative to controls. We also examined indirect mechanisms of change through intervening variables (e.g., indoor tanning attitudes, norms, positive and negative expectancies) using the product of coefficient approach. The web-based intervention demonstrated efficacy in changing adolescent indoor tanning motivations and improving their orientation toward healthier alternatives. Results from the intervening variable analyses give guidance to future adolescent skin cancer prevention interventions.	1b
3238937	[Study of middle molecular weight fraction in the plasma of patients with uremia using high performance liquid chromatography and thin layer chromatography].	Detection and quantitative estimation of peptides were carried out in the middle molecular fraction of blood plasma from patients with uremia using high performance liquid chromatography and thin-layer chromatography. The middle molecular fraction was separated into four fractions after ultrafiltration through a column of Protein Pak i-60. As low as 40-60 mcg/ml of the peptides were detected in the first and second fractions.	4
7059946	Thermochemotherapy for melanoma metastases in liver.	Metastatic melanoma in the liver has carried an extremely poor prognosis regardless of therapy. Because transient responses (1/6 disease regressions and 2/6 disease stabilizations for four months) in selected patients treated with intraarterial (IA) DTIC infusion were encouraging and because localized hyperthermia may be both tumoricidal and synergistic with chemotherapy, these modalities were combined for treatment of patients with advanced liver metastases. Of 10 patients treated with IA-DTIC plus heat, three (30%) had disease-regression and five (50%) had disease stabilization for 3-14 months (median 6.5 months) and survived 3.5-18 months (median 8.5 months). During treatment, 4/5 patients had pain relief and 7/10 retained or acquired normal activities. Myelosuppression was minimal and no hyperthermia toxicity occurred. A retrospective review of 10 patients with similar disease levels who were treated with conventional intravenous (IV)-DTIC indicated no responses, and no responses were seen in five patients treated with IV-DTIC plus heat. However, this latter group may have been selected patients due to the inability to place a percutaneous hepatic artery infusion catheter. This pilot study suggests that combination IA-DTIC and hyperthermia has a high response rate, is safe, and can provide quality survival for many patients.	4
29869799	Mu-opioid antagonists for opioid-induced bowel dysfunction in people with cancer and people receiving palliative care.	BACKGROUND: Opioid-induced bowel dysfunction (OIBD) is characterised by constipation, incomplete evacuation, bloating, and gastric reflux. It is one of the major adverse events of treatment for pain in cancer and in palliative care, resulting in increased morbidity and reduced quality of life.This is an update of two Cochrane reviews. One was published in 2011, Issue 1 on laxatives and methylnaltrexone for the management of constipation in people receiving palliative care; this was updated in 2015 and excluded methylnaltrexone. The other was published in 2008, Issue 4 on mu-opioid antagonists (MOA) for OIBD. In this updated review, we only included trials on MOA (including methylnaltrexone) for OIBD in people with cancer and people receiving palliative care. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness and safety of MOA for OIBD in people with cancer and people receiving palliative care. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and Web of Science to August 2017. We also searched clinical trial registries and regulatory websites. We contacted manufacturers of MOA to identify further data. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that assessed the effectiveness and safety of MOA for OIBD in people with cancer and people at a palliative stage irrespective of the type of terminal disease they experienced. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors assessed risk of bias and extracted data. The appropriateness of combining data from the trials depended upon sufficient homogeneity across the trials. Our primary outcomes were laxation, impact on pain relief, and adverse events. Impact on pain relief was a primary outcome because a possible adverse effect of MOAs is a reduction in pain relief from opioids. We assessed the evidence on these outcomes using GRADE. MAIN RESULTS: We identified four new trials for this update, bringing the total number included in this review to eight. In total, 1022 men and women with cancer irrespective of stage or at a palliative care stage of any disease were randomised across the trials. The MOAs evaluated were oral naldemedine and naloxone (alone or in combination with oxycodone), and subcutaneous methylnaltrexone. The trials compared with MOA with a placebo or with the active intervention administered at different doses or in combination with other drugs. The trial of naldemedine and the two of naloxone in combination with oxycodone were in people with cancer irrespective of disease stage. The trial on naloxone alone was in people with advanced cancer. The four trials on methylnaltrexone were undertaken in palliative care where most participants had cancer. All trials were vulnerable to biases; four were at a high risk as they involved a sample of fewer than 50 participants per arm.In the trial of naldemedine compared to placebo in 225 participants, there were more spontaneous laxations over the two-week treatment for the intervention group (risk ratio (RR) 1.93, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 1.36 to 2.74; moderate-quality evidence). In comparison with higher doses, lower doses resulted in fewer spontaneous laxations (0.1 mg versus 0.2 mg: RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.95; 0.1 mg versus 0.4 mg: RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.89; moderate-quality evidence). There was moderate-quality evidence that naldemedine had no effect on opiate withdrawal. There were five serious adverse events. All were in people taking naldemedine (low-quality evidence). There was an increase in the occurrence of other (non-serious) adverse events in the naldemedine groups (RR 1.36, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.79, moderate-quality evidence). The most common adverse event was diarrhoea.The trials on naloxone taken either on its own, or in combination with oxycodone (an opioid) compared to oxycodone only did not evaluate laxation response over the first two weeks of administration. There was very low-quality evidence that naloxone alone, and moderate-quality evidence that oxycodone/naloxone, had no effect on analgesia. There was low-quality evidence that oxycodone/naloxone did not increase the risk of serious adverse events and moderate-quality evidence that it did not increase risk of adverse events.In combined analysis of two trials of 287 participants, we found methylnaltrexone compared to placebo induced more laxations within 24 hours (RR 2.77, 95% CI 1.91 to 4.04. I(2) = 0%; moderate-quality evidence). In combined analysis, we found methylnaltrexone induced more laxation responses over two weeks (RR 9.98, 95% CI 4.96 to 20.09. I(2) = 0%; moderate-quality evidence). The proportion of participants who had a rescue-free laxation response within 24 hours of the first dose was 59.1% in the methylnaltrexone arms and 19.1% in the placebo arm. There was moderate-quality evidence that the rate of opioid withdrawal was not affected. Methylnaltrexone did not increase the likelihood of a serious adverse event; there were fewer in the intervention arm (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.93; I(2) = 0%; moderate-quality evidence). There was no difference in the proportion of participants experiencing an adverse event (RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.45; I(2) = 74%; low-quality evidence). Methylnaltrexone increased the likelihood of abdominal pain and flatulence.Two trials compared differing methylnaltrexone schedules of higher doses with lower doses. For early laxation, there was low-quality evidence of no clear difference between doses on analgesia and adverse events. Both trials measured laxation response within 24 hours of first dose (trial one: RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.41 to 1.66; trial two: RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.42). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: In this update, the conclusions for naldemedine are new. There is moderate-quality evidence to suggest that, taken orally, naldemedine improves bowel function over two weeks in people with cancer and OIBD but increases the risk of adverse events. The conclusions on naloxone and methylnaltrexone have not changed. The trials on naloxone did not assess laxation at 24 hours or over two weeks. There is moderate-quality evidence that methylnaltrexone improves bowel function in people receiving palliative care in the short term and over two weeks, and low-quality evidence that it does not increase adverse events. There is a need for more trials including more evaluation of adverse events. None of the current trials evaluated effects in children.	1a
17825518	Prognostic value of sentinel node biopsy in 327 prospective melanoma patients from a single institution.	AIM: To confirm the accuracy of sentinel node biopsy (SNB) procedure and its morbidity, and to investigate predictive factors for SN status and prognostic factors for disease-free survival (DFS) and disease-specific survival (DSS). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between October 1997 and December 2004, 327 consecutive patients in one centre with clinically node-negative primary skin melanoma underwent an SNB by the triple technique, i.e. lymphoscintigraphy, blue-dye and gamma-probe. Multivariate logistic regression analyses as well as the Kaplan-Meier were performed. RESULTS: Twenty-three percent of the patients had at least one metastatic SN, which was significantly associated with Breslow thickness (p<0.001). The success rate of SNB was 99.1% and its morbidity was 7.6%. With a median follow-up of 33 months, the 5-year DFS/DSS were 43%/49% for patients with positive SN and 83.5%/87.4% for patients with negative SN, respectively. The false-negative rate of SNB was 8.6% and sensitivity 91.4%. On multivariate analysis, DFS was significantly worsened by Breslow thickness (RR=5.6, p<0.001), positive SN (RR=5.0, p<0.001) and male sex (RR=2.9, p=0.001). The presence of a metastatic SN (RR=8.4, p<0.001), male sex (RR=6.1, p<0.001), Breslow thickness (RR=3.2, p=0.013) and ulceration (RR=2.6, p=0.015) were significantly associated with a poorer DSS. CONCLUSION: SNB is a reliable procedure with high sensitivity (91.4%) and low morbidity. Breslow thickness was the only statistically significant parameter predictive of SN status. DFS was worsened in decreasing order by Breslow thickness, metastatic SN and male gender. Similarly DSS was significantly worsened by a metastatic SN, male gender, Breslow thickness and ulceration. These data reinforce the SN status as a powerful staging procedure.	2b
8892458	Phase III double-blind evaluation of an aloe vera gel as a prophylactic agent for radiation-induced skin toxicity.	PURPOSE: Considerable pilot data and clinical experience suggested that an aloe vera gel might help to prevent radiation therapy-induced dermatitis. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Two Phase III randomized trials were conducted. The first one was double blinded, utilized a placebo gel, and involved 194 women receiving breast or chest wall irradiation. The second trial randomized 108 such patients to aloe vera gel vs. no treatment. Skin dermatitis was scored weekly during both trials both by patients and by health care providers. RESULTS: Skin dermatitis scores were virtually identical on both treatment arms during both of the trials. The only toxicity from the gel was rare contact dermatitis. CONCLUSIONS: This dose and schedule of an aloe vera gel does not protect against radiation therapy-induced dermatitis.	1b
16020959	Prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, randomized phase III study with orally administered budesonide for prevention of irinotecan (CPT-11)-induced diarrhea in patients with advanced colorectal cancer.	BACKGROUND: Unpredictable and severe diarrhea (NCI grade > or =3) remains a life-threatening adverse event in patients treated with irinotecan (CPT-11). The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of orally administered budesonide for prevention of CPT-11-induced delayed diarrhea in patients with advanced colorectal cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 56 patients with advanced colorectal cancer receiving CPT-11 therapy (125 mg/m2 once weekly) were enrolled in this multicenter trial. Patients were randomly treated with 3 mg budesonide orally 3 times daily versus placebo. Detailed assessment of diarrhea by monitoring stool frequency, stool consistency and loperamide rescue medication was made by keeping a diary. RESULTS: Diarrhea, defined as number of stools >4 occurring on a single day during the study period, could be prevented in 58.3% of the budesonide-treated patients compared to 38.5% of the patients under placebo. Patients in the budesonide group had less episodes (0.7 vs. 2.2 episodes) and a considerably shorter total duration of diarrhea (1.8 vs. 4.2 days) episodes than patients in the placebo group. Loperamide use was more frequent in the placebo than in the budesonide arm (55.6 vs. 41.7%). Also, exposure to rescue medication of loperamide was higher for placebo (36.2 capsules) than for budesonide (24.9 capsules). A superior prevention of diarrhea was observed for budesonide compared to placebo in the first cycle (14 vs. 10; p = 0.257), with more failures observed in the placebo group (16 vs. 10). CONCLUSION: This double-blind randomized trial failed to show that budesonide has a significant benefit in preventing CPT-11-induced diarrhea. While a trend exists, further trials are warranted.	2b
24982463	Surgery alone versus chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery for stage I and II esophageal cancer: final analysis of randomized controlled phase III trial FFCD 9901.	PURPOSE: Although often investigated in locally advanced esophageal cancer (EC), the impact of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (NCRT) in early stages is unknown. The aim of this multicenter randomized phase III trial was to assess whether NCRT improves outcomes for patients with stage I or II EC. METHODS: The primary end point was overall survival. Secondary end points were disease-free survival, postoperative morbidity, in-hospital mortality, R0 resection rate, and prognostic factor identification. From June 2000 to June 2009, 195 patients in 30 centers were randomly assigned to surgery alone (group S; n = 97) or NCRT followed by surgery (group CRT; n = 98). CRT protocol was 45 Gy in 25 fractions over 5 weeks with two courses of concomitant chemotherapy composed of fluorouracil 800 mg/m(2) and cisplatin 75 mg/m(2). We report the long-term results of the final analysis, after a median follow-up of 93.6 months. RESULTS: Pretreatment disease was stage I in 19.0%, IIA in 53.3%, and IIB in 27.7% of patients. For group CRT compared with group S, R0 resection rate was 93.8% versus 92.1% (P = .749), with 3-year overall survival rate of 47.5% versus 53.0% (hazard ratio [HR], 0.99; 95% CI, 0.69 to 1.40; P = .94) and postoperative mortality rate of 11.1% versus 3.4% (P = .049), respectively. Because interim analysis of the primary end point revealed an improbability of demonstrating the superiority of either treatment arm (HR, 1.09; 95% CI, 0.75 to 1.59; P = .66), the trial was stopped for anticipated futility. CONCLUSION: Compared with surgery alone, NCRT with cisplatin plus fluorouracil does not improve R0 resection rate or survival but enhances postoperative mortality in patients with stage I or II EC.	1b
24252855	Accuracy and prognostic value of sentinel lymph node biopsy in head and neck melanomas.	BACKGROUND: Debate remains around the accuracy and prognostic implications of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) for melanoma arising in the head and neck (HN) areas because several analyses have shown discordances between clinically predicted lymphatic drainage pathways and those identified by lymphoscintigraphy. This study assesses the accuracy and prognostic value of SLNB in this critical anatomic region. METHODS: Retrospective review of a prospectively collected melanoma database identified 331 patients with HN melanomas from January 2000 to December 2012. Primary end points included SLNB result, time to recurrence, site of recurrence, and survival. Multivariate models were constructed for analyses. RESULTS: A sentinel lymph node (SLN) was identified in all 331 patients. There were 59 patients with a positive SLN (17.8%) with a recurrence rate of 88.1% compared with 22.4% in SLN-negative patients (P < 0.0001). The 5-y overall survival was 91.2% for SLN-negative patients and 48.7% for SLN-positive patients (P < 0.0001). Patients with scalp melanoma had thicker lesions and an elevated risk of SLN positivity, recurrence, and death compared with those with other sites. Among the 272 SLN-negative patients, four patients developed regional nodal disease in the same basin and had undergone a previous SLNB procedure for a false-omission rate of 1.45%. Risks for false-negative SLN occurrences included thick and scalp melanomas. Multivariate analysis on prognostic factors affecting relapse-free survival showed positive SLNB status to be the most prognostic clinicopathologic predictor of recurrence (hazard ratio, 20.56; P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: SLNB for patients with HN melanomas is an accurate procedure and has prognostic value.	3a
28159465	A comparison of sentinel lymph node biopsy to lymphadenectomy for endometrial cancer staging (FIRES trial): a multicentre, prospective, cohort study.	BACKGROUND: Sentinel-lymph-node mapping has been advocated as an alternative staging technique for endometrial cancer. The aim of this study was to measure the sensitivity and negative predictive value of sentinel-lymph-node mapping compared with the gold standard of complete lymphadenectomy in detecting metastatic disease for endometrial cancer. METHODS: In the FIRES multicentre, prospective, cohort study patients with clinical stage 1 endometrial cancer of all histologies and grades undergoing robotic staging were eligible for study inclusion. Patients received a standardised cervical injection of indocyanine green and sentinel-lymph-node mapping followed by pelvic lymphadenectomy with or without para-aortic lymphadenectomy. 18 surgeons from ten centres (tertiary academic and community non-academic) in the USA participated in the trial. Negative sentinel lymph nodes (by haematoxylin and eosin staining on sections) were ultra-staged with immunohistochemistry for cytokeratin. The primary endpoint, sensitivity of the sentinel-lymph-node-based detection of metastatic disease, was defined as the proportion of patients with node-positive disease with successful sentinel-lymph-node mapping who had metastatic disease correctly identified in the sentinel lymph node. Patients who had mapping of at least one sentinel lymph node were included in the primary analysis (per protocol). All patients who received study intervention (injection of dye), regardless of mapping result, were included as part of the assessment of mapping and in the safety analysis in an intention-to-treat manner. The trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01673022 and is completed and closed. FINDINGS: Between Aug 1, 2012, and Oct 20, 2015, 385 patients were enrolled. Sentinel-lymph-node mapping with complete pelvic lymphadenectomy was done in 340 patients and para-aortic lymphadenectomy was done in 196 (58%) of these patients. 293 (86%) patients had successful mapping of at least one sentinel lymph node. 41 (12%) patients had positive nodes, 36 of whom had at least one mapped sentinel lymph node. Nodal metastases were identified in the sentinel lymph nodes of 35 (97%) of these 36 patients, yielding a sensitivity to detect node-positive disease of 97.2% (95% CI 85.0-100), and a negative predictive value of 99.6% (97.9-100). The most common grade 3-4 adverse events or serious adverse events were postoperative neurological disorders (4 patients) and postoperative respiratory distress or failure (4 patients). 22 patients had serious adverse events, with one related to the study intervention: a ureteral injury incurred during sentinel-lymph-node dissection. INTERPRETATION: Sentinel lymph nodes identified with indocyanine green have a high degree of diagnostic accuracy in detecting endometrial cancer metastases and can safely replace lymphadenectomy in the staging of endometrial cancer. Sentinel lymph node biopsy will not identify metastases in 3% of patients with node-positive disease, but has the potential to expose fewer patients to the morbidity of a complete lymphadenectomy.

15750360	Homeopathy for menopausal symptoms in breast cancer survivors: a preliminary randomized controlled trial.	"OBJECTIVES: To carry out a preliminary trial evaluating the effectiveness of two types of homeopathy for the treatment of menopausal symptoms in breast cancer survivors. DESIGN: Randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled. SETTINGS/LOCATION: Private medical clinic, Seattle, WA. SUBJECTS: Women with a history of breast cancer who had completed all surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation treatment and who had an average of at least three hot flashes per day for the previous month. INTERVENTIONS: Subjects were randomized to receive either an individualized homeopathic single remedy, a homeopathic combination medicine, or placebo. Patients were seen by homeopathic providers every 2 months for 1 year. OUTCOME MEASURES: Hot flash frequency and severity, Kupperman Menopausal Index (KMI), Short Form 36 (SF-36). RESULTS: There was no significant difference found in the primary outcome measure, the hot flash severity score, although there was a positive trend in the single remedy group during the first 3 months of the study (p = 0.1). A statistically significant improvement in general health score in both homeopathy groups (p < 0.05) on the SF-36 after 1 year was found. Evidence of a homeopathic ""drug proving"" in the subjects receiving the homeopathic combination medicine who were not taking tamoxifen also was found. CONCLUSIONS: Small sample size precludes definitive answers, but results from this preliminary trial suggest that homeopathy may be of value in the treatment of menopausal symptoms and improving quality of life, especially in those women not on tamoxifen. Larger studies should be carried out that also include healthy women who want to avoid hormone replacement therapy."	1b
7551258	Gastrointestinal metastases from malignant melanoma.	Between 1980 and 1992, 68 patients with clinical indications of involvement of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract with metastatic melanoma were treated at Roswell Park Cancer Institute. Presenting symptoms were anaemia, abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting. Sites commonly involved were the small bowel (75%), the large intestine (25%), and the stomach (16%). Twenty-one patients were considered unsuitable for surgery; their median survival after diagnosis of GI metastases was 2.9 months. Forty-seven patients underwent abdominal surgery; effective palliation was achieved in most of them. Complete resection of GI metastases was accomplished in 47% of patients. The median survival after operation was 27.6 months for patients with complete resection of GI metastasis and no other disease, 5.1 months for patients with resection of involved GI tract and other metastases present, and 1.9 months for patients who had a by-pass procedure only. The 5-year survival for patients with complete resection of GI metastases and no other evidence of disease was 28.3%. The other groups had only 1-year survivors. Surgical intervention is justified on the basis of these findings, and extended palliation can be achieved in patients with complete resection of metastatic disease.	3b
21775914	Clinical significance of portal-superior mesenteric vein resection in pancreatoduodenectomy for pancreatic head cancer.	OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to determine the significance of portal vein-superior mesenteric vein (PV-SMV) invasion on survival in patients who underwent margin-negative pancreatoduodenectomy (PD) with PV-SMV resection for pancreatic adenocarcinoma. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the records of 60 patients who underwent margin-negative PD with or without PV-SMV resection for pancreatic adenocarcinoma between August 2001 and December 2007. The depth of vessel invasion was investigated and was categorized into 3 groups: tunica adventitia, media, and intima. Clinicopathologic factors and survival were analyzed. RESULTS: Portal vein-superior mesenteric vein resection was performed on 19 patients, but only 15 patients (78.9%) had histologically true invasion and showed poorer survival (median survival, 14 vs 9 months; P < 0.05). Univariate analysis revealed that poorly differentiated tumor, lymphatic invasion, endovascular invasion, PV-SMV invasion, and invasion into the intima of PV-SMV were statistically significant. Poorly differentiated tumor and invasion into the intima of PV-SMV were significant in multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Aggressive surgical resection should be attempted in cases with suspected PV-SMV invasion because 21.1% of patients had no true invasion and showed better survival than those with true invasion. However, invasion into the tunica intima may be a poor prognostic factor for survival even after margin-negative PD for pancreatic adenocarcinoma.	2b
23374159	Is confocal microscopy a valuable tool in diagnosing nodular lesions? A study of 140 cases.	BACKGROUND: Nodular lesions pose diagnostic challenges because nodular melanoma may simulate all kinds of melanocytic and nonmelanocytic lesions. Reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) is a novel technique that allows visualization of the skin at nearly histological resolution although limited laser depth penetration hampers visualization of the deep dermis. OBJECTIVES: We sought to assess whether the diagnostic accuracy of RCM was comparable to histopathology for the diagnosis of nodular lesions, and to identify possible limitations of this technique. METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated 140 nodules by means of RCM while blinded from the histopathological diagnosis. At the end of the study the patient codes were broken and the evaluations were matched with histopathological diagnosis before performing statistical analysis. RESULTS: The study consisted of 140 nodular lesions (23 'pure' nodular melanomas, nine melanoma metastases, 28 BCCs, six invasive SCCs, 32 naevi, 14 seborrhoeic keratoses, 17 dermatofibromas, five vascular lesions and six other lesions). RCM correctly diagnosed 121 of 140 lesions (86.4%); eight of 140 (5.7%) lesions revealed discordance between histopathology and confocal microscopy. Eight of the 140 (5.7%) cases were not evaluable by means of RCM due to the presence of ulceration or hyperkeratosis and three cases showed a nonspecific pattern. Interestingly, confocal microscopy reached a 96.5% sensitivity and 94.1% specificity (area under curve 0.970) (95% CI 0.924-1.015) (P < 0.001) for the diagnosis of melanoma. CONCLUSIONS: The study is retrospective and lesions were not included on the basis of their diagnostic difficulty. Despite the limited laser depth penetration of RCM, this imaging tool represents an effective instrument in diagnosing nodular lesions; however, for fully ulcerated lesions or when a marked hyperkeratosis is present, biopsy should always be performed. Prospective studies on difficult-to-diagnose nodules should be performed to analyse further the pros and cons of RCM in skin cancer diagnosis.	3a
27141885	Safety profiles of anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 antibodies alone and in combination.	Inhibition of immune checkpoints using anti-programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) or anti cytotoxic-T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) monoclonal antibodies has revolutionized the management of patients with advanced-stage melanoma and is among the most promising treatment approaches for many other cancers. Use of CTLA-4 and PD-1 inhibitors, either as single agents, or in combination, has been approved by the US FDA for the treatment of metastatic melanoma. Treatment with these novel immunotherapies results in a unique and distinct spectrum of adverse events, which are mostly related to activation of the immune system and are, therefore, an unwanted consequence of their mechanisms of action. Adverse effects of CTLA-4 and/or PD-1 inhibition are most commonly observed in the skin, gastrointestinal tract, liver and endocrine systems and include pruritus, rash, nausea, diarrhoea and thyroid disorders. In this Review, the authors describe the adverse event profile of checkpoint inhibitors targeting CTLA-4 and PD-1, used both as monotherapies and in combination and aim to provide some general guidelines, based upon the mechanisms of action of these therapies and on the management of these immune-related adverse events.	2a
29676960	Psychotherapy Targeting Depression and Anxiety for Use in Palliative Care: A Meta-Analysis.	BACKGROUND: Research on the effectiveness of evidence-based practices in the treatment of depression and anxiety with palliative care populations is primarily limited to individuals having specific conditions such as cancer. OBJECTIVE: This meta-analysis examined the effect of psychotherapy on depression and anxiety among individuals with any condition appropriate for palliative care. METHODS: We searched PubMed, PsycINFO, Cochrane Library, and EMBASE databases until August 2017. Eligible studies were randomized controlled trials of psychotherapy that reported outcomes of depression and anxiety and included adults with serious illnesses. RESULTS: The current meta-analysis included 32 randomized controlled trials with 36 samples including 1536 participants undergoing psychotherapy. Overall, findings suggest that psychotherapy in palliative care populations reduced depression (large effect) and anxiety (small effect) symptoms. Psychotherapy also improved quality of life (small effect). Significant moderators of intervention effects included type of intervention and provider, number and length of treatment sessions, and sample age. Cognitive-behaviorally based and other therapies (e.g., acceptance, mindfulness) showed significant effects, as did interventions delivered by mental health providers. More treatment sessions were associated with greater effect sizes; longer sessions were associated with decreased effect sizes. As the sample age increased, the study effect size decreased. CONCLUSION: Findings suggest that psychotherapy for individuals with serious illnesses appropriate for palliative care can mitigate symptoms of depression and anxiety and improve quality of life. Methodological reporting and quality of research designs in studies of psychotherapy for palliative patient populations could be improved. Future research is needed with a broader range of patient populations.	1a
20804429	Development of bladder outlet obstruction after a single treatment of prostate cancer with high-intensity focused ultrasound: experience with 226 patients.	PURPOSE: To investigate the occurrence of bladder outlet obstruction (BOO) after high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) therapy of prostate cancer, the need for secondary transurethral interventions for BOO, and the benefit of transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) before HIFU. PATIENTS AND METHODS: After a single HIFU treatment between 2002 and 2007, 226 consecutive patients were examined and followed at least 2 years. The Ablatherm Maxis and the Integrated Imaging devices were used. The sites of BOO were recorded. RESULTS: Median follow-up after HIFU was 52 months (range 24-80 mos). BOO developed in 58 (25.66%) patients. Repeated BOO episodes were observed in 27 (11.94%), three to seven episodes in 13 (5.75%) patients. Patients with repeated BOO were older than patients with singular BOO (71.75 +/- 4.97 vs 68.18 +/- 5.03; P = 0.024). In primary BOO, multiple sites of obstruction were more often involved than in repeated BOO (25/58 vs 8/27). Conversely, isolated bladder neck stenosis was predominantly found in patients with >/=two episodes of BOO. The rate of primary BOO was significantly different between patients who had undergone TURP the same day as HIFU or within 2 days of HIFU (33/96; 34.38%) and patients with TURP more than 1 month (16/89; 17.98%) before HIFU (P = 0.032). BOO occurred in 21.95% (9/41) of the patients who were treated with HIFU only. CONCLUSIONS: BOO after HIFU is common, particularly affecting the bladder neck. The risk of repeated BOO is associated with age. A longer interval between TURP and HIFU (>1 month) might reduce the risk for the development of BOO.	3a
2921110	Needle aspiration biopsy of the pre-epiglottic space.	Clinical staging of supraglottic carcinoma requires evaluation of the pre-epiglottic space (PES). To explore the role of fine needle aspiration biopsy of the PES in the staging of epiglottic carcinoma, endoscopic transvallecular fine needle aspiration biopsies of the PES were performed in 16 patients with epiglottic carcinoma. The results of aspiration cytology were compared with CT scanning and postoperative histopathologic sections of the PES after total or supraglottic laryngectomy. This preliminary report shows that needle aspiration biopsy of the PES is a safe and sensitive technique, having a high correlation with histopathologic follow-up. Needle biopsy, along with CT scan, is clinically useful in staging the PES, which cannot be examined directly.	4
22051508	Safety and clinical activity of ipilimumab in melanoma patients with brain metastases: retrospective analysis of data from a phase 2 trial.	Melanoma has a high propensity to metastasize to the brain, and this is often responsible for treatment failure in patients with advanced disease. Melanoma patients with brain metastases are usually excluded from clinical trials because of their expected survival of approximately 5 months. A growing body of evidence suggests that ipilimumab, a human monoclonal antibody that blocks cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4, has activity against melanoma brain metastases. We conducted a retrospective analysis of data from a phase II study of ipilimumab in advanced melanoma patients. Twelve of 115 patients randomized in the parent trial had stable brain metastases at baseline, as identified by an Independent Review Committee, and were evaluated for efficacy. Two of the 12 patients achieved a partial response and three had stable disease. Both patients with a partial response and one with stable disease were alive at the last follow-up, with survival time of more than 4 years. The median overall survival of the 12 patients was 14 months (range: 2.7-56.4+). An additional four patients with stable brain metastases at baseline were identified by a secondary Independent Review Committee reviewer, and were evaluated for safety. Central nervous system-related adverse events of grade 3-4, specifically cerebral edema and convulsion/seizure, occurred in two of 16 patients. Although the present study is limited by the fact that it is a retrospective analysis of a small number of patients, the results provide further evidence for the safety and efficacy of ipilimumab in melanoma patients with stable brain metastases.	4
20558980	Outcomes of radical prostatectomy in clinically locally advanced N0M0 prostate cancer.	INTRODUCTION: Radical prostatectomy (RP) in patients with locally advanced (cT3) prostate cancer (PCa) is considered an optional therapy. AIM: To evaluate outcomes of surgery for cT3 disease and to compare results with those of patients treated for cT1-T2 PCa. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data of 74 consecutive patients with cT3 N0M0 PCa who underwent RP were compared to those of 425 consecutive unselected patients who underwent surgery for cT1-T2 N0M0 disease. RESULTS: cT3: The pathological report showed a pathological downstaging in 16.3% of cases. Continence rate was 65.5%, potency rate was 38.8%, 5-year PSA-free survival was 61.9%, 5-year cancer-specific survival was 95.2%. cT1-T2: The pathological report showed a clinical downstaging in 39.1%. Continence rate was 70.8%, potency rate was 56.2%, 5-year PSA-free survival was 67.4%, 5-year cancer-specific survival was 96.0%. CONCLUSIONS: cT3 PCa presents challenges for the uro-oncologist since standard treatment is still under debate. RP in well-informed patients is a procedure with acceptable morbidity and should be at least a first part of a multimodality approach.	3a
27161539	Complete lymph node dissection versus no dissection in patients with sentinel lymph node biopsy positive melanoma (DeCOG-SLT): a multicentre, randomised, phase 3 trial.	BACKGROUND: Complete lymph node dissection is recommended in patients with positive sentinel lymph node biopsy results. To date, the effect of complete lymph node dissection on prognosis is controversial. In the DeCOG-SLT trial, we assessed whether complete lymph node dissection resulted in increased survival compared with observation. METHODS: In this multicentre, randomised, phase 3 trial, we enrolled patients with cutaneous melanoma of the torso, arms, or legs from 41 German skin cancer centres. Patients with positive sentinel lymph node biopsy results were eligible. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to undergo complete lymph node dissection or observation with permuted blocks of variable size and stratified by primary tumour thickness, ulceration of primary tumour, and intended adjuvant interferon therapy. Treatment assignment was not masked. The primary endpoint was distant metastasis-free survival and analysed by intention to treat. All patients in the intention-to-treat population of the complete lymph node dissection group were included in the safety analysis. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02434107. Follow-up is ongoing, but the trial no longer recruiting patients. FINDINGS: Between Jan 1, 2006, and Dec 1, 2014, 5547 patients were screened with sentinel lymph node biopsy and 1269 (23%) patients were positive for micrometastasis. Of these, 483 (39%) agreed to randomisation into the clinical trial; due to difficulties enrolling and a low event rate the trial closed early on Dec 1, 2014. 241 patients were randomly assigned to the observation group and 242 to the complete lymph node dissection group. Ten patients did not meet the inclusion criteria, so 233 patients were analysed in the observation group and 240 patients were analysed in the complete lymph node dissection group, as the intention-to-treat population. 311 (66%) patients (158 in the observation group and 153 in the dissection group) had sentinel lymph node metastases of 1 mm or less. Median follow-up was 35 months (IQR 20-54). Distant metastasis-free survival at 3 years was 77.0% (90% CI 71.9-82.1; 55 events) in the observation group and 74.9% (69.5-80.3; 54 events) in the complete lymph node dissection group. In the complete lymph node dissection group, grade 3 and 4 events occurred in 15 patients (6%) and 19 patients (8%) patients, respectively. Adverse events included lymph oedema (grade 3 in seven patients, grade 4 in 13 patients), lymph fistula (grade 3 in one patient, grade 4 in two patients), seroma (grade 3 in three patients, no grade 4), infection (grade 3 in three patients, no grade 4), and delayed wound healing (grade 3 in one patient, grade 4 in four patients); no serious adverse events were reported. INTERPRETATION: Although we did not achieve the required number of events, leading to the trial being underpowered, our results showed no difference in survival in patients treated with complete lymph node dissection compared with observation only. Consequently, complete lymph node dissection should not be recommended in patients with melanoma with lymph node micrometastases of at least a diameter of 1 mm or smaller.

29788836	Intracranial hemorrhage in adults on ECMO.	RATIONALE: Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) use has exploded over the last decade. However, it remains invasive and associated with significant complications, including tamponade, infection, thrombosis, gas embolism and bleeding. The most dreaded complication is intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). In this article, we review the literature on the incidence, diagnosis, risk factors, pathophysiology, prognosis, prevention and management of ICH in adults on ECMO. MAIN FINDINGS: We found a high incidence of ICH in the literature with a poor prognosis. Important risk factors included pre-ECMO cardiac arrest, sepsis, influenza, renal failure, renal replacement therapy, hemolysis and thrombocytopenia. The optimal anticoagulation strategy is still uncertain. As platelet dysfunction and depletion appear to play an important role in the pathogenesis of ICH in patients on ECMO, a liberal platelet transfusion strategy may be advised. Prompt computed tomography (CT) diagnosis is of great importance as interventions to limit hematoma expansion and secondary neurological injury are most effective if instituted early. Transporting patients to the radiology department can be performed safely while on ECMO. A strategy combining screening CT on admission with a heparin-free period of extracorporeal support was demonstrated to be safe in VV-ECMO patients and resulted in a better prognosis compared to similar cohorts in the literature. CONCLUSION: Despite major technological improvements and all the experience gained in adults, ECMO remains associated with a high incidence of ICH. There are still wide gaps in our understanding of the disease. Optimal management strategies that minimize the risk of ICH and improve prognosis need to be further studied.	2b
24750486	Distinct melanoma types based on reflectance confocal microscopy.	Distinct melanoma types exist in relation to patient characteristics, tumor morphology, histopathologic aspects and genetic background. A new diagnostic imaging tool, reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM), allows in vivo analysis of a given lesion with nearly histologic resolution while offering a dynamic view of the tissue in its 'natural' environment. The aim of this study was to analyse cell morphology of consecutive melanomas as they appear on RCM and to correlate morphology with tumor and patient characteristics. One hundred melanomas were visualized by RCM before excision. Clinical data, confocal features and histologic criteria were analysed. Four types of melanomas were identified as follows: (i) Melanomas with a predominantly dendritic cell population ('dendritic-cell melanomas') typically were thin by Breslow index; (ii) Melanomas typified by roundish melanocytes were smaller in size than dendritic cell MMs, but thicker by Breslow index, and predominantly occurred in patients with a high nevus count; (iii) Melanomas characterized by dermal nesting proliferation usually were thick by Breslow index at the time of diagnosis, although frequently smaller in size compared with the other types; and (iv) combined type melanomas may represent an evolution of dendritic cell and/or round cell types. Integration of confocal microscopy with clinical and histologic aspects may help in identifying and managing distinct tumors.	3a
12676037	Effects of adjunctive Swedish massage and vibration therapy on short-term postoperative outcomes: a randomized, controlled trial.	OBJECTIVE: To examine the effects of adjunctive postoperative massage and vibration therapy on short-term postsurgical pain, negative affect, and physiologic stress reactivity. DESIGN: Prospective, randomized controlled trial. The treatment groups were: (1) usual postoperative care (UC); (2) UC plus massage therapy; or (3) UC plus vibration therapy. SETTING: The University of Virginia Hospital Surgical Units, Gynecology-Oncology Clinic, and General Clinical Research Center. SUBJECTS: One hundred and five (N = 105) women who underwent an abdominal laparotomy for removal of suspected cancerous lesions. INTERVENTIONS: All patients received UC with analgesic medication. Additionally, the massage group received standardized 45-minute sessions of gentle Swedish massage on the 3 consecutive evenings after surgery and the vibration group received 20-minute sessions of inaudible vibration therapy (physiotones) on the 3 consecutive evenings after surgery, as well as additional sessions as desired. OUTCOME MEASURES: Sensory pain, affective pain, anxiety, distress, analgesic use, systolic blood pressure, 24-hour urine free cortisol, number of postoperative complications, and days of hospitalization. RESULTS: On the day of surgery, massage was more effective than UC for affective (p = 0.0244) and sensory pain (p = 0.0428), and better than vibration for affective pain (p = 0.0015). On postoperative day 2, massage was more effective than UC for distress (p = 0.0085), and better than vibration for sensory pain (p = 0.0085). Vibration was also more effective than UC for sensory pain (p = 0.0090) and distress (p = .0090). However, after controlling for multiple comparisons and multiple outcomes, no significant differences were found. CONCLUSIONS: Gentle Swedish massage applied postoperatively may have minor effects on short-term sensory pain, affective pain, and distress among women undergoing an abdominal laparotomy for removal of suspected malignant tissues.	2b
18794543	Prospective randomized study comparing docetaxel, estramustine, and prednisone with docetaxel and prednisone in metastatic hormone-refractory prostate cancer.	PURPOSE: To assess the efficacy and toxicity of the addition of estramustine to docetaxel (D) for the treatment of metastatic hormone-refractory prostate cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred fifty patients were randomly assigned to D alone (35 mg/m(2) on days 2 and 9, every 3 weeks) or D in combination with estramustine (D/E; 280 mg orally three times a day on days 1 to 5 and 8 to 12, every 3 weeks). All patients received prednisone (10 mg/d). The primary end point was prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response rate, which was defined as a decrease in PSA > or = 50% from baseline. The study was powered to test the hypothesis that D/E would improve the PSA response rate by 25%. RESULTS: The PSA response rate was not statistically different between the two groups. PSA of less than 4 ng/mL occurred in 29 (41%) of 71 patients receiving D/E and in 17 (25%) of 69 patients receiving D (P = .05). No significant differences were found for median time to PSA progression (D/E, 6.9 months; D, 7.3 months) or median overall survival time (D/E, 19.3 months; D, 21 months). More patients had at least one grade 3 or 4 toxicity with D/E (45%) compared with D (21%; P = .005), mainly as a result of grade 3 or 4 GI toxicity (P = .05). Serious adverse events were more frequent with D/E (n = 20) than with D (n = 9; P = .04). CONCLUSION: The addition of estramustine to weekly D does not provide any clinically relevant advantage. Both regimens are well tolerated, although the toxicity profile favors D without estramustine.	1a
11115819	Oral glutamine in the prevention of fluorouracil induced intestinal toxicity: a double blind, placebo controlled, randomised trial.	BACKGROUND: 5-Fluorouracil (FU) in association with folinic acid (FA) is the most frequently used chemotherapeutic agent in colorectal cancer but it often causes diarrhoea. Animal and human studies suggest that glutamine stimulates intestinal mucosal growth. AIM: To determine if oral glutamine prevents changes in intestinal absorption (IA) and permeability (IP) induced by FU/FA. METHODS: Seventy chemotherapy naive patients with colorectal cancer were randomly assigned to oral glutamine (18 g/day) or placebo before the first cycle of FU (450 mg/m(2)) and FA (100 mg/m(2)) administered intravenously for five days. Treatment was continued for 15 days, starting five days before the beginning of chemotherapy. IA (D-xylose urinary excretion) and IP (cellobiose-mannitol test) were assessed at baseline and four and five days after the end of the first cycle of chemotherapy, respectively. Patients kept a daily record of diarrhoea, scored using the classification system of the National Cancer Institute (Bethesda, Maryland, USA). Duration of diarrhoea was recorded and the area under the curve (AUC) was calculated for each patient. RESULTS: Baseline patient characteristics and basal values of IP and IA tests were similar in the two arms. After one cycle of chemotherapy, the reduction in IA (D-xylose absorption) was more marked in the placebo arm (7.1% v 3. 8%; p=0.02); reduction of IP to mannitol was higher in the placebo arm (9.2% v 4.5%; p=0.02); and urinary recovery of cellobiose was not different between the study arms (p=0.60). Accordingly, the cellobiose-mannitol ratio increased more in the placebo arm (0.037 v 0.012; p=0.04). Average AUC of diarrhoea (1.9 v 4.5; p=0.09) and average number of loperamide tablets taken (0.4 v 2.6; p=0.002) were reduced in the glutamine arm. CONCLUSIONS: Glutamine reduces changes in IA and IP induced by FU and may have a protective effect on FU induced diarrhoea.	2b
17057389	Prospective controlled cohort studies on long-term therapy of breast cancer patients with a mistletoe preparation (Iscador).	BACKGROUND: Mistletoe preparations such as Iscador (Weleda, Schwabisch Gmund, Germany) are commonly used in complementary and alternative / anthroposophic medicine for many cancer indications, particularly for solid cancers. Efficacy of this complementary therapy is still controversial. OBJECTIVE: Does long-term therapy with Iscador show any effect on survival, tumor progression and psychosomatic self-regulation of patients with breast cancer? PATIENTS AND METHODS: Prospective recruitment and long-term follow-up of two controlled cohort studies: (1) Randomized matched-pair study (38 pairs): breast cancer patients without any recurrences or metastases and no mistletoe therapy were matched for prognostic factors. By pairwise random allocation, one of the patients was suggested mistletoe therapy to be applied by the attending physician. (2) Non-randomized matched-pair study (84 pairs): breast cancer patients without recurrences or metastases that already received mistletoe therapy were matched to control patients without Iscador therapy. RESULTS: For overall survival, the nonrandomized study shows significant effects in favor of Iscador therapy: hazard ratio HR estimate and 95% confidence interval CI: 0.43 (0.27-0.68). The effect of long-term Iscador therapy on tumor progression as measured by the time to local recurrences, lymphatic or distant metastases in breast cancer patients without any such events at first diagnosis, is in most cases significant in favor of the Iscador group, in the randomized as well as in the non-randomized study. Psychosomatic self-regulation in the Iscador group improves significantly within 12 months compared with the control group in the randomized as well as in the non-randomized study: estimate of the median difference and 95% CI: 0.35 (0.05-0.60), respectively 0.20 (0-0.35). CONCLUSION: Iscador shows a clinically relevant effect on breast tumor progression as measured by overall survival as well as by the time to recurrences, lymphatic or distant metastases. In the short term, psychosomatic self-regulation increases more markedly under complementary Iscador therapy than under conventional therapy alone.	2b
24663288	Stereotactic radiosurgery for newly diagnosed brain metastases: comparison of three dose levels.	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Three doses were compared for local control of irradiated metastases, freedom from new brain metastases, and survival in patients receiving stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) alone for one to three newly diagnosed brain metastases. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In all, 134 patients were assigned to three groups according to the SRS dose given to the margins of the lesions: 13-16 Gy (n = 33), 18 Gy (n = 18), and 20 Gy (n = 83). Additional potential prognostic factors were evaluated: age (</= 60 vs. > 60 years), gender, Karnofsky Performance Scale score (70-80 vs. 90-100), tumor type (non-small-cell lung cancer vs. melanoma vs. others), number of brain metastases (1 vs. 2-3), lesion size (< 15 vs. >/= 15 mm), extracranial metastases (no vs. yes), RPA class (1 vs. 2), and interval of cancer diagnosis to SRS (</= 24 vs. > 24 months). RESULTS: For 13-16 Gy, 18 Gy, and 20 Gy, the 1-year local control rates were 31, 65, and 79%, respectively (p < 0.001). The SRS dose maintained significance on multivariate analysis (risk ratio: 2.25; 95% confidence interval: 1.56-3.29; p < 0.001). On intergroup comparisons of local control, 20 Gy was superior to 13-16 Gy (p < 0.001) but not to 18 Gy (p = 0.12); 18 Gy showed a strong trend toward better local control when compared with 13-16 Gy (p = 0.059). Freedom from new brain metastases (p = 0.57) and survival (p = 0.15) were not associated with SRS dose in the univariate analysis. CONCLUSION: SRS doses of 18 Gy and 20 Gy resulted in better local control than 13-16 Gy. However, 20 Gy and 18 Gy must be compared again in a larger cohort of patients. Freedom from new brain metastases and survival were not associated with SRS dose.	3b
9215828	Interferon alfa-2a and interleukin-2 with or without cisplatin in metastatic melanoma: a randomized trial of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Melanoma Cooperative Group.	PURPOSE: The combination of interferon alfa-2a (IFN alpha) and high-dose interleukin-2 (IL-2) is active in metastatic melanoma. The addition of cisplatin (CDDP) has resulted in response rates greater than 50%. This study was performed to determine whether the addition of CDDP to a cytokine treatment regimen with IFN alpha and high-dose IL-2 influences survival of patients with metastatic melanoma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with advanced metastatic melanoma were randomly assigned to receive treatment with IFN alpha 10 x 10(6) U/m2 subcutaneously on days 1 through 5 and a high-dose intravenous decrescendo regimen of IL-2 on days 3 through 8 (18 mIU/ m2/6 hours, 18 mIU/m2/12 hours, 18 mIU/m2/24 hours, and 4.5 mIU/m2/24 hours x 3) without (arm A) or with (arm B) CDDP 100 mg/m2 on day 1. Treatment cycles were repeated every 28 days to a maximum of four cycles. RESULTS: One hundred thirty-eight patients with advanced metastatic melanoma, of whom 87% had visceral metastases, were accrued for the trial. Both regimens were feasible in a multicenter setting. The objective response rate was 18% without and 33% with CDDP (P = .04). The progression-free survival was 53 days without and 92 days with CDDP (P = .02, Wilcoxon; P = .09, log-rank). There was no statistically significant difference in survival between treatment arms, with a median overall survival duration for all patients of 9 months. CONCLUSION: The addition of CDDP to cytokine treatment with IFN alpha and IL-2 does not influence survival of patients with advanced metastatic melanoma, despite a significant increase in response rate and progression-free survival.	1b
27368007	Early analysis of surrogate endpoints for metastatic melanoma in immune checkpoint inhibitor trials.	Recent major phase III trials led to the approval of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ipilimumab, pembrolizumab, and nivolumab) in metastatic malignant melanoma (MM). We aim to assess whether median progression-free survival, and 1 and 2-year overall survival (OS) rates are reliable surrogate endpoints for median OS through a meta-analysis of published trials involving immunotherapy. A systematic literature search in PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and SCOPUS of published phase II to III trials with immunotherapy as the treatment for MM was conducted. Adjusted weighted linear regression was used to calculate Pearson correlations (R) between surrogates and median OS, and between treatment effects on surrogates and median OS. A total of 13 studies involving 3373 patients with MM were identified. The correlation of progression-free survival with OS was not significant (R = 0.45, P = .11). Conversely, the correlation between 1-year OS and median OS was very strong (R = 0.93, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.84-0.96, P < .00001), as was the correlation between 2-year OS and OS (R = 0.79, 95% CI 0.51-0.91, P = .0001). The correlation between the treatment effects on 1-year OS and OS was also significant (R = -0.86, 95% CI -0.3 to 0.97, P = .01). Similar results were obtained for 2-year OS. According to the available study data, 1-year OS rate could be regarded as a potential surrogate for median OS in novel immunotherapy trials of metastatic MM. Waiting for ongoing studies (e.g., pembrolizumab), we suggest that this intermediate endpoint could be considered as a potential primary endpoint in future clinical trials.	1a
21506018	Mindfulness based stress reduction in post-treatment breast cancer patients: an examination of symptoms and symptom clusters.	To investigate prevalence and severity of symptoms and symptom clustering in breast cancer survivors who attended MBSR(BC). Women were randomly assigned into MBSR(BC) or Usual Care (UC). Eligible women were >/= 21 years, had been diagnosed with breast cancer and completed treatment within 18 months of enrollment. Symptoms and interference with daily living were measured pre- and post-MBSR(BC) using the M.D. Anderson Symptom Inventory. Symptoms were reported as highly prevalent but severity was low. Fatigue was the most frequently reported and severe symptom among groups. Symptoms clustered into 3 groups and improved in both groups. At baseline, both MBSR(BC) and the control groups showed similar mean symptom severity and interference; however, after the 6-week post-intervention, the MBSR(BC) group showed statistically-significant reduction for fatigue and disturbed sleep (P < 0.01) and improved symptom interference items, compared to the control group. For the between-group comparisons, 11 of 13 symptoms and 5 of 6 interference items had lower means in the MBSR(BC) condition than the control condition. These results suggest that MBSR(BC) modestly decreases fatigue and sleep disturbances, but has a greater effect on the degree to which symptoms interfere with many facets of life. Although these results are preliminary, MBSR intervention post-treatment may effectively reduce fatigue and related interference in QOL of breast cancer survivors.	2b
17054269	Neo-adjuvant and adjuvant hormone therapy for localised and locally advanced prostate cancer.	BACKGROUND: Hormone therapy for early prostate cancer has demonstrated an improvement in clinical and pathological variables, but not always an improvement in overall survival. We performed a systematic review of both adjuvant and neo-adjuvant hormone therapy combined with surgery or radiotherapy in localised or locally advanced prostate cancer. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this review was to undertake a systematic review and, if possible, a meta-analysis of neo-adjuvant and adjuvant hormone therapy in localised or locally advanced prostate cancer. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched MEDLINE (1966-2006), EMBASE, The Cochrane Library, Science Citation Index, LILACS, and SIGLE for relevant randomised trials. Handsearching of appropriate publications was also undertaken. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials of patients with localised or locally advanced prostate cancer, that is, stages T1-T4, any N, M0, comparing neo-adjuvant or adjuvant hormonal deprivation in combination with primary therapy (radical radiotherapy or radical prostatectomy) versus primary therapy alone were included in this review. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data were extracted from eligible studies and assessed for quality, and included information on study design, participants, interventions, and outcomes. Comparable data were pooled together for meta-analysis with intention-to treat principle. MAIN RESULTS: Men with prostate cancer have different clinical outcomes based on their risk (T1-T2, T3-T4, PSA levels and Gleason score). However, the majority of studies included in this review did not report results by risk groups; therefore, it was not possible to perform sub-group analysis. Neo-adjuvant hormonal therapy prior to prostatectomy did not improve overall survival (OR 1.11, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.85, P = 0.69). However, there was a significant reduction in the positive surgical margin rate (OR 0.34, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.42, P < 0.00001) and a significant improvement in other pathological variables such as lymph node involvement, pathological staging and organ confined rates. There was a borderline significant reduction of disease recurrence rates (OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.0, P = 0.05), in favour of treatment. The use of longer duration of neo-adjuvant hormones, that is either 6 or 8 months prior to prostatectomy, was associated with a significant reduction in positive surgical margins (OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.80, P = 0.002). In one study, neo-adjuvant hormones prior to radiotherapy significantly improved overall survival for Gleason 2 to 6 patients; although, in two studies, there was no improvement in disease-specific survival (OR 0.99, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.32, P = 0.97). However, there was a significant improvement in both clinical disease-free survival (OR 1.86, 95% CI 1.93 to 2.40, P < 0.00001) and biochemical disease-free survival (OR 1.93, 95% CI 1.45 to 2.56, P < 0.00001). Adjuvant androgen deprivation following prostatectomy did not significantly improve overall survival at 5 years (OR 1.50, 95% CI 0.79 to 2.85, P = 0.2); although one study reported a significant disease-specific survival advantage with adjuvant therapy (P = 0.001). In addition, there was a significant improvement in disease-free survival at both 5 years (OR 3.73, 95%CI 2.30 to 6.03, P < 0.00001) and 10 years (OR 2.06, 95% CI 1.34 to 3.15, P = 0.0009). Adjuvant therapy following radiotherapy resulted in a significant overall survival gain apparent at 5 (OR 1.46, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.83, P = 0.0009) and 10 years (OR 1.44, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.84, P = 0.003); although there was significant heterogeneity (P = 0.09 and P = 0.07, respectively). There was also a significant improvement in disease-specific survival (OR 2.10, 95% CI 1.53 to 2.88, P = 0.00001) and disease-free survival (OR 2.53, 95% CI 2.05 to 3.12, P < 0.00001) at 5 years. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Hormone therapy combined with either prostatectomy or radiotherapy is associated with significant clinical benefits in patients with local or locally advanced prostate cancer. Significant local control may be achieved when given prior to prostatectomy or radiotherapy, which may improve patient's quality of life. When given adjuvant to these primary therapies, hormone therapy, not only provides a method for local control, but there is also evidence for a significant survival advantage. However, hormone therapy is associated with significant side effects, such as hot flushes and gynaecomastia, as well as cost implications. The decision to use hormone therapy should, therefore, be taken at a local level, between the patient, clinician and policy maker, taking into account the clinical benefits, toxicity and cost. More research is needed to guide the choice, the duration, and the schedule of hormonal deprivation therapy, and the impact of long-term hormone therapy with regard to toxicity and the patient's quality of life.	1a
27223498	BRAF inhibitor and stereotactic radiosurgery is associated with an increased risk of radiation necrosis.	We retrospectively compared the outcomes and toxicities of melanoma brain metastases (MBM) patients treated with BRAF inhibitors (BRAFi) and stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) with SRS alone. We identified 87 patients with 157 MBM treated with SRS alone from 2005 to 2013. Of these, 15 (17.2%) patients with 32 MBM (21.4%) received BRAFi therapy: three (20.0%) before SRS, two (13.3%) concurrent, and 10 (66.7%) after SRS. Overall survival (OS) was compared between cohorts using the product limit method. Intracranial outcomes were compared using cumulative incidence with competing risk for death. Baseline patient characteristics were similar between groups, except for the SRS cohort, which had higher rates of chemotherapy and more recent year of diagnosis. Radiation characteristics, including dose per fraction, total dose, gross tumor volume size, and prescription isodose, were also similar between cohorts. One-year outcomes - OS (64.3 vs. 40.4%, P=0.205), local failure (3.3 vs. 9.6%, P=0.423), and distant intracranial failure (63.9 vs. 65.1%, P=0.450) were not statistically different between the SRS+BRAFi and SRS-alone groups, respectively. The SRS+BRAFi group showed higher rates of radiographic radiation necrosis (RN) (22.2 vs. 11.0% at 1 year, P<0.001) and symptomatic radiation necrosis (SRN) (28.2 vs. 11.1% at 1 year, P<0.001). Multivariable analysis showed that BRAFi predicted an increased risk of both radiographic and SRN. SRS and BRAFi predicted for an increased risk of radiographic and SRN compared with SRS alone. Approaches to mitigate RN for patients receiving SRS and BRAFi should be considered until the clinical trial (http//:www.clinicaltrials.gov: NCT01721603) evaluating this treatment regimen is completed.	3a
21257902	Radioembolization as salvage therapy for hepatic metastasis of uveal melanoma: a single-institution experience.	OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to assess the safety and efficacy of radioembolization in the management of hepatic metastasis of uveal melanoma after failure of immunoembolization or chemoembolization. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From January 2007 through April 2009, 32 patients underwent radioembolization therapy for hepatic metastasis of uveal melanoma. Pretreatment tumor burdens were divided into three categories: less than 25% (n = 25), 25-50% (n = 5), and greater than 50% (n = 2). Toxicity, extrahepatic disease, and hepatic tumor response were assessed 1 month and then every 3 months after treatment. Best radiographic response of hepatic metastasis was determined with the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors criteria. Overall survival and progression-free survival of hepatic metastasis were estimated by Kaplan-Meier analysis. Differences in survival between subgroups were evaluated by log-rank test in univariate analysis. RESULTS: The clinical follow-up period ranged from 1.0 to 29.0 months (median, 10.0 months). The median overall survival was 10.0 months, and the progression-free survival of hepatic metastasis, 4.7 months. Twenty-two patients died 1.0-29.0 months (median, 5.8 months) after treatment owing to progression of liver disease (n = 13), extrahepatic disease (n = 4), or both (n = 5). Patients who had a pretreatment tumor burden less than 25% had longer median overall survival (10.5 vs 3.9 months, p = 0.0003) and progression-free survival (6.4 vs 3.0 months, p = 0.03) than patients who had a pretreatment tumor burden of 25% or greater. Patients who had a complete response (n = 1), partial response (n = 1), or stable disease (n = 18) had longer median overall survival (14.7 vs 4.9 months, p = 0.0006) and progression-free survival of hepatic metastasis (7.9 vs 3.1 months, p < 0.0001) than patients with tumor progression (n = 12). Self-limiting grade 1-2 systemic toxicity included tiredness (n = 9), indigestion (n = 2), and abdominal discomfort (n = 5). Grade 3-4 hepatic toxicity was attributed to tumor progression. CONCLUSION: Radioembolization is safe and effective salvage therapy for limited metastasis of uveal melanoma.	4
23708871	Does vitamin E protect salivary glands from I-131 radiation damage in patients with thyroid cancer?	OBJECTIVES: Salivary gland impairment after high-dose radioiodine ((1)(3)(1)I) treatment is well recognized. The aim of this study was to determine the protective effect of vitamin E on radiation-induced salivary gland dysfunction in patients undergoing (1)(3)(1)I treatment for differentiated thyroid cancer. METHODS: Thirty-six patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma were enrolled in this study. They were randomly divided into two groups before postsurgical ablation therapy with 3700-5550 MBq (1)(3)(1)I: the control group, comprising 17 patients, and the vitamin E group, comprising 19 patients. All 19 patients in the experimental group received vitamin E at a dose of 800 IU/day for a duration of 1 week before to 4 weeks after I therapy and the 17 patients in the control group received a placebo for the same duration. Salivary gland function was assessed using salivary gland scintigraphy with intravenous injection of 370 MBq Tc-pertechnetate in two phases, one immediately before and the other 6 months after (1)(3)(1)I ablative therapy. First-minute uptake ratio, maximum uptake ratio, maximum secretion percentage, and excretion fraction (EF) of each salivary gland were measured and compared between the study phases for the two groups. RESULTS: There was no significant difference between preablative and postablative salivary scintigraphic indices in the experimental vitamin E group, whereas maximum secretion percentage and EF of the right submandibular gland and EF of the left parotid gland were significantly decreased in the control group. There was also a higher significant decrease in the EF of the left parotid gland in the control group compared with the vitamin E group. CONCLUSION: Vitamin E consumption may be associated with a significant protective effect against radiation-induced dysfunction in salivary glands following single-dose (1)(3)(1)I therapy in patients with differentiated thyroid cancer.	2b
20670857	Number of metastatic lymph nodes, but not lymph node ratio, is an independent prognostic factor after resection of pancreatic carcinoma.	BACKGROUND: This study evaluated the prognostic significance of the number of metastatic lymph nodes and the ratio of metastatic nodes to total number of examined lymph nodes (lymph node ratio, LNR) after resection of pancreatic carcinoma. STUDY DESIGN: Records of 119 consecutive patients with pancreatic ductal carcinoma, who underwent R0 or R1 pancreatectomy with regional node dissection, were reviewed retrospectively. Clinical factors, pathologic factors including number of metastatic nodes and LNR, and survival were analyzed by univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: Overall survival rates were 78%, 28%, and 20% at 1, 3, and 5 years, respectively. The median numbers of evaluated lymph nodes and involved nodes were 28 and 3, respectively. Univariate analysis revealed that tumor location, postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy, tumor differentiation, choledochal invasion, portal or splenic vein invasion, extrapancreatic nerve plexus invasion, resection margin status, node status, number of involved nodes, LNR, International Union against Cancer (UICC) pT factor, and UICC stage correlated significantly (p < 0.05) with increased survival. By multivariate analysis, negative node metastasis (p = 0.008) and 0 or 1 involved node (p = 0.004), but not LNR, correlated independently with longer survival. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates of patients with 0 or 1 metastatic node and patients with 2 or more metastatic nodes were 91%, 48%, and 40% and 66%, 10%, and 0%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The number of metastatic nodes, but not LNR, is one of the most powerful prognostic factors after resection of pancreatic carcinoma.	2b
26254030	Endometrial cancer and oral contraceptives: an individual participant meta-analysis of 27 276 women with endometrial cancer from 36 epidemiological studies.	BACKGROUND: Oral contraceptives are known to reduce the incidence rate of endometrial cancer, but it is uncertain how long this effect lasts after use ceases, or whether it is modified by other factors. METHODS: Individual participant datasets were sought from principal investigators and provided centrally for 27 276 women with endometrial cancer (cases) and 115 743 without endometrial cancer (controls) from 36 epidemiological studies. The relative risks (RRs) of endometrial cancer associated with oral contraceptive use were estimated using logistic regression, stratified by study, age, parity, body-mass index, smoking, and use of menopausal hormone therapy. FINDINGS: The median age of cases was 63 years (IQR 57-68) and the median year of cancer diagnosis was 2001 (IQR 1994-2005). 9459 (35%) of 27 276 cases and 45 625 (39%) of 115 743 controls had ever used oral contraceptives, for median durations of 3.0 years (IQR 1-7) and 4.4 years (IQR 2-9), respectively. The longer that women had used oral contraceptives, the greater the reduction in risk of endometrial cancer; every 5 years of use was associated with a risk ratio of 0.76 (95% CI 0.73-0.78; p<0.0001). This reduction in risk persisted for more than 30 years after oral contraceptive use had ceased, with no apparent decrease between the RRs for use during the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, despite higher oestrogen doses in pills used in the early years. However, the reduction in risk associated with ever having used oral contraceptives differed by tumour type, being stronger for carcinomas (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.66-0.71) than sarcomas (0.83, 0.67-1.04; case-case comparison: p=0.02). In high-income countries, 10 years use of oral contraceptives was estimated to reduce the absolute risk of endometrial cancer arising before age 75 years from 2.3 to 1.3 per 100 women. INTERPRETATION: Use of oral contraceptives confers long-term protection against endometrial cancer. These results suggest that, in developed countries, about 400 000 cases of endometrial cancer before the age of 75 years have been prevented over the past 50 years (1965-2014) by oral contraceptives, including 200 000 in the past decade (2005-14).

23033409	Indoor tanning and non-melanoma skin cancer: systematic review and meta-analysis.	OBJECTIVE: To synthesise the literature on indoor tanning and non-melanoma skin cancer. DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES: PubMed (1966 to present), Embase (1974 to present), and Web of Science (1898 to present). STUDY SELECTION: All articles that reported an original effect statistic for indoor tanning and non-melanoma skin cancer were included. Articles that presented no data, such as review articles and editorials, were excluded, as were articles in languages other than English. DATA EXTRACTION: Two investigators independently extracted data. Random effects meta-analysis was used to summarise the relative risk of ever use versus never use of indoor tanning. Dose-response effects and exposure to indoor tanning during early life were also examined. The population attributable risk fraction for the United States population was calculated. RESULTS: 12 studies with 9328 cases of non-melanoma skin cancer were included. Among people who reported ever using indoor tanning compared with those who never used indoor tanning, the summary relative risk for squamous cell carcinoma was 1.67 (95% confidence interval 1.29 to 2.17) and that for basal cell carcinoma was 1.29 (1.08 to 1.53). No significant heterogeneity existed between studies. The population attributable risk fraction for the United States was estimated to be 8.2% for squamous cell carcinoma and 3.7% for basal cell carcinoma. This corresponds to more than 170 000 cases of non-melanoma skin cancer each year attributable to indoor tanning. On the basis of data from three studies, use of indoor tanning before age 25 was more strongly associated with both squamous cell carcinoma (relative risk 2.02, 0.70 to 5.86) and basal cell carcinoma (1.40, 1.29 to 1.52). CONCLUSIONS: Indoor tanning is associated with a significantly increased risk of both basal and squamous cell skin cancer. The risk is higher with use in early life (<25 years). This modifiable risk factor may account for hundreds of thousands of cases of non-melanoma skin cancer each year in the United States alone and many more worldwide. These findings contribute to the growing body of evidence on the harms of indoor tanning and support public health campaigns and regulation to reduce exposure to this carcinogen.	2a
2693850	Dacarbazine versus dacarbazine-vindesine in disseminated malignant melanoma: a randomized phase II study.	In a phase II study 119 patients with disseminated malignant melanoma were randomized to receive treatment with dacarbazine alone or in combination with vindesine. The study was designed to reveal an additive response rate when the drugs were combined. Dacarbazine was given i.v. at 250 mg m-2 per day X V every 4 weeks. In the combination regimen vindesine given at 3 mg m-2 per week was included. One hundred and ten patients were available for evaluation of response. With dacarbazine 4/51 patients obtained a complete remission (8%) and 5/51 patients a partial remission (10%). Overall response rate was 18%. With dacarbazine-vindesine 8/59 patients obtained a complete remission (13%) and 7/59 patients a partial remission (12%). Overall response rate was 25%. The difference in response rates observed between the treatment arms is not statistically significant. Median response duration was 123 days for dacarbazine patients and 171 days for patients receiving dacarbazine-vindesine (difference not statistically significant).	1b
15337553	Phase II double-blind randomized study comparing oral aloe vera versus placebo to prevent radiation-related mucositis in patients with head-and-neck neoplasms.	PURPOSE: In a single-institution, double-blind, prospective, randomized trial, we determined whether oral aloe vera gel can reduce radiation-induced mucositis in head-and-neck cancer patients. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We randomized 58 head-and-neck cancer patients between oral aloe vera and placebo. To be included in this Phase II protocol, patients had to be treated with radiotherapy with curative intent at Stanford University between February 1999 and March 2002. We examined patients biweekly for mucositis at 15 head-and-neck subsites and administered quality-of-life questionnaires. RESULTS: Patients in the aloe and placebo groups were statistically identical in baseline characteristics. By the end of treatment, the two groups were also statistically identical in maximal grade of toxicity, duration of Grade 2 or worse mucositis, quality-of-life scores, percentage of weight loss, use of pain medications, hydration requirement, oral infections, and prolonged radiation breaks. CONCLUSION: In our randomized study, oral aloe vera was not a beneficial adjunct to head-and-neck radiotherapy. The mean quality-of-life scores were greater in the aloe vera group, but the differences were not statistically significant. Oral aloe vera did not improve tolerance to head-and-neck radiotherapy, decrease mucositis, reduce soreness, or otherwise improve patient well-being.	2b
25993262	Skin Cancer Diagnosis With Reflectance Confocal Microscopy: Reproducibility of Feature Recognition and Accuracy of Diagnosis.	IMPORTANCE: Reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) studies have been performed to identify criteria for diagnosis of skin neoplasms. However, RCM-based diagnosis is operator dependent. Hence, reproducibility of RCM criteria needs to be tested. OBJECTIVE: To test interobserver reproducibility of recognition of previously published RCM descriptors and accuracy of RCM-based skin cancer diagnosis. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Observational retrospective web-based study of a set of RCM images collected at a tertiary academic medical center. Nine dermatologists (6 of whom had >/=3 years of RCM experience) from 6 countries evaluated an RCM study set from 100 biopsy-proven lesions, including 55 melanocytic nevi, 20 melanomas, 15 basal cell carcinomas, 7 solar lentigines or seborrheic keratoses, and 3 actinic keratoses. Between June 15, 2010, and October 21, 2010, participanting dermatologists, blinded to histopathological diagnosis, evaluated 3 RCM mosaic images per lesion for the presence of predefined RCM descriptors. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The main outcome was identification of RCM descriptors with fair to good interrater agreement (kappa statistic, >/=0.3) and independent correlation with malignant vs benign diagnosis on discriminant analysis. Additional measures included sensitivity and specificity for diagnosis of malignant vs benign for each evaluator, for majority diagnosis (rendered by >/=5 of 9 evaluators), and for experienced vs recent RCM users. RESULTS: Eight RCM descriptors showed fair to good reproducibility and were independently associated with a specific diagnosis. Of these, the presence of pagetoid cells, atypical cells at the dermal-epidermal junction, and irregular epidermal architecture were associated with melanoma. Aspecific junctional pattern, basaloid cords, and ulceration were associated with basal cell carcinomas. Ringed junctional pattern and dermal nests were associated with nevi. The mean sensitivity for the group of evaluators was 88.9% (range, 82.9%-100%), and the mean specificity was 79.3% (range, 69.2%-90.8%). Majority diagnosis showed sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 80.0%. Sensitivity was higher for experienced vs recent RCM users (91.0% vs. 84.8%), but specificity was similar (80.0% vs. 77.9%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The study highlights key RCM diagnostic criteria for melanoma and basal cell carcinoma that are reproducibly recognized among RCM users. Diagnostic accuracy increases with experience. The higher accuracy of majority diagnosis suggests that there is intrinsically more diagnostic information in RCM images than is currently used by individual evaluators.	3a
20973155	Morphine versus oxycodone in pancreatic cancer pain: a randomized controlled study.	OBJECTIVE: According to experimental findings, oxycodone (OX) could have some advantages over morphine (MO) in clinical models of visceral pain. It was hypothesized that OX could have some advantages over MO in terms of efficacy and dose escalation in pancreatic cancer pain. METHODS: Sixty patients with pancreatic cancer with a pain intensity rating of 4/10 who required opioids were included in the study. Patients were randomized to receive 30 mg/d of sustained release oral MO or sustained release oral OX (20 mg/d). Opioid doses were increased according to the clinical needs. Daily doses of opioids, pain and symptom intensity were recorded at admission (T0) and at weekly intervals for the subsequent 4 weeks (T1, T2, T3, and T4), with an extension at 8 weeks (T8). Opioid escalation index (OEI) as percentage (OEI %) and in mg (OEI mg) was calculated. RESULTS: Nineteen and 20 patients in groups OX and MO, respectively, were followed for the entire period of study (T4). No differences between groups were found in age (P=0.400), Karnofsky (P=0.667), or escalation indexes at T4 and T8 (OEImg, P=0.945 and OEI %, P=0.295). No statistical differences in pain and symptoms intensity between the groups were observed. CONCLUSION: OX and MO provided similar analgesia and adverse effects with similar escalating doses in patients with pancreatic cancer pain, resembling observations reported in the general cancer pain population. The experimental hypothesis that OX would be superior to MO in the clinical model of pancreatic cancer pain was not confirmed.	1a
24095905	Impact of folate intake on prostate cancer recurrence following definitive therapy: data from CaPSURE.	PURPOSE: A randomized, placebo controlled clinical trial of folic acid supplementation for the chemoprevention of colorectal adenoma revealed an increased incidence of prostate cancer in the treatment group. Limited data exist on postdiagnostic folate/folic acid intake and the risk of prostate cancer progression. We prospectively examined the association between postdiagnostic folate consumption and the risk of prostate cancer recurrence after radical prostatectomy, external beam radiation therapy and brachytherapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was done in 1,153 men treated with radical prostatectomy, external beam radiation therapy and brachytherapy who had clinical stage T1-T2c prostate adenocarcinoma and participated in the CaPSURE Diet and Lifestyle substudy by completing the semiquantitative Food Frequency Questionnaire in 2004 to 2005. We used Cox proportional hazards regression to analyze the association between folate intake and prostate cancer progression. RESULTS: Prostate cancer progressed in 101 men (8.76%) during a mean 34-month followup. After multivariate adjustment we observed no evidence of an association of the intake of total folate, dietary folate or dietary folate equivalents with prostate cancer recurrence. On secondary analysis by treatment after radical prostatectomy patients in the lowest decile of dietary folate intake had a 2.6-fold increase in the risk of recurrence (HR 2.56, 95% CI 1.23-5.29, p = 0.01). In patients treated with external beam radiation and brachytherapy we observed no evidence of an association between prostate cancer progression and increased folate intake. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that the consumption of foods and multivitamins that contain folate is not associated with prostate cancer progression after definitive treatment.	2b
9591028	Treatment of liver metastases from uveal melanoma by combined surgery-chemotherapy.	AIMS: To investigate sporadic results demonstrating prolonged survival after surgical resection and/or intraarterial chemotherapy (IACH) for liver metastases from uveal melanoma. METHODS: From December 1992 to March 1997 every patient with liver metastases from uveal melanoma was enrolled in a prospective study including: (1) aggressive surgical approach removing as much liver disease as possible; (2) implantation of an intraaterial catheter; (3) intraarterial chemotherapy for 6 months. 75 patients were enrolled: 38 men, 37 women, mean age 51 years (range: 18-72), mean time from initial diagnosis of uveal melanoma to liver metastases 37 months (ranged: 1-168). RESULTS: Disseminated disease in both lobes was present in all but one patient. Macroscopically curative surgery was possible in 27.5%. Significant tumour reduction was performed in 49.3% and a simple biopsy was possible in 23.2%. Eight patients did not receive chemotherapy and died soon after. IACH included Fotemustine and/or DTIC-Platinum for 4-9 cycles. Overall median survival was 9 months; very similar to non-operated historical controls. In the 61 patients receiving complete treatment surgery plus chemotherapy, median survival improved to 10 months. When curative resection was possible, survival increased to 22 months (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Aggressive surgical resection, when possible, appears to be the best method of improving survival of liver metastases from uveal melanoma. New drug combinations are also required to improve survival.	4
11561871	Retrolective cohort study of an additive therapy with an oral enzyme preparation in patients with multiple myeloma.	PURPOSE: To evaluate the impact of an additive therapy with an oral enzyme (OE) preparation given for more than 6 months additionally to standard combination chemotherapy (vincristine/melphalan/cyclophosphamide/prednisone (VMCP)- or methylprednisolone/ vincristine/CCNU/cyclophosphamide/melphalan (MOCCA)-regimen) in the primary treatment of patients with multiple myeloma stages I-III. METHODS: A cohort of 265 patients with multiple myeloma stages I-III was consecutively treated at our institution in two parallel groups (control group (n = 99): chemotherapy +/-OE for less than 6 months; OE-group (n = 166): chemotherapy + OE for more than 6 months). The median follow-up time in the stages I, II, and III for the OE-group was 61, 37, and 46.5 months, respectively; for the control group the respective values were 33, 51.5, and 31.5 months. The primary endpoint of the study was disease-specific survival. Secondary endpoints were response to therapy, duration of first response and side effects. The chosen method for evaluation was the technique of a retrolective cohort analysis with a concurrent control group. Survival analysis was performed by the Kaplan-Meier method and multivariate analysis was done with the Cox proportional hazards model. RESULTS: Significantly higher overall response rates and longer duration of remissions were observed in the OE-group. Primary responders showed a longer mean survival time than non-responders. Additive therapy with OE given for more than 6 months decreased the hazard of death for patients at all stages of disease by approximately 60%. Observation time was not long enough to estimate the median survival for patients at stages I and II; for stage III patients it was 47 months in the control group versus 83 months for the patients treated with OE (P = 0.0014) which means a 3-year gain of survival time. Significant prognostic factors for survival, in the Cox regression analysis, were stage of disease and therapy with OE. The OE-therapy was generally well tolerated (3.6% of patients with mild to moderate gastrointestinal symptoms). CONCLUSION: OEs represent a promising new additive therapy in multiple myeloma which will be further evaluated in a randomized phase III trial in the USA.	2b
17960012	Cisplatin, fluorouracil, and docetaxel in unresectable head and neck cancer.	BACKGROUND: Phase 2 studies suggest that the standard regimen of cisplatin and fluorouracil (PF) plus docetaxel (TPF) improves outcomes in squamous-cell carcinoma of the head and neck. We compared TPF with PF as induction chemotherapy in patients with locoregionally advanced, unresectable disease. METHODS: We randomly assigned eligible patients between the ages of 18 and 70 years who had stage III or stage IV disease and no distant metastases to receive either TPF (docetaxel and cisplatin, day 1; fluorouracil by continuous infusion, days 1 to 5) or PF every 3 weeks for four cycles. Patients without progression of disease received radiotherapy within 4 to 7 weeks after completing chemotherapy. The primary end point was progression-free survival. RESULTS: A total of 358 patients underwent randomization, with 177 assigned to the TPF group and 181 to the PF group. At a median follow-up of 32.5 months, the median progression-free survival was 11.0 months in the TPF group and 8.2 months in the PF group (hazard ratio for disease progression or death in the TPF group, 0.72; P=0.007). Treatment with TPF resulted in a reduction in the risk of death of 27% (P=0.02), with a median overall survival of 18.8 months, as compared with 14.5 months in the PF group. There were more grade 3 or 4 events of leukopenia and neutropenia in the TPF group and more grade 3 or 4 events of thrombocytopenia, nausea, vomiting, stomatitis, and hearing loss in the PF group. The rates of death from toxic effects were 2.3% in the TPF group and 5.5% in the PF group. CONCLUSIONS: As compared with the standard regimen of cisplatin and fluorouracil, induction chemotherapy with the addition of docetaxel significantly improved progression-free and overall survival in patients with unresectable squamous-cell carcinoma of the head and neck. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00003888 [ClinicalTrials.gov].).	1b
21873971	Intraoperative radiation therapy on pancreatic cancer patients: a review of the literature.	Pancreatic cancer is rarely curable, and the overall survival rate at 5 years is under 4%. This study aimed to assess the efficacy, effectiveness and safety of intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT) as treatment in pancreatic cancer, by means of a systematic review of the literature. We searched Pubmed from 1980 until 2010 by means of prospective randomized trials. The aim was to assess the potential impact of IORT on local control, quality of life and overall survival. The search was restricted to articles published in English. IORT offers the opportunity to administer high doses of irradiation to areas of neoplastic involvement while attempting simultaneously to spare normal tissues in the region from potentially damaging radiation exposure. However, the results were not in favour of IORT in the case of pancreatic cancer in locally advanced and metastatic stages. There is no clear evidence to indicate the IORT as more effective than other therapies in treating pancreatic cancer.	1b
23897970	Reduction of cancer-related fatigue with dexamethasone: a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in patients with advanced cancer.	PURPOSE: Cancer-related fatigue (CRF) is the most common symptom in patients with advanced cancer. The primary objective of this prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was to compare the effect of dexamethasone and placebo on CRF. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with advanced cancer with >/= three CRF-related symptoms (ie, fatigue, pain, nausea, loss of appetite, depression, anxiety, or sleep disturbance) >/= 4 of 10 on the Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale (ESAS) were eligible. Patients were randomly assigned to either dexamethasone 4 mg or placebo orally twice per day for 14 days. The primary end point was change in the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness-Fatigue (FACIT-F) subscale from baseline to day 15. Secondary outcomes included anorexia, anxiety, depression, and symptom distress scores. RESULTS: A total of 84 patients were evaluable (dexamethasone, 43; placebo, 41). Mean (+/- standard deviation) improvement in the FACIT-F subscale at day 15 was significantly higher in the dexamethasone than in the placebo group (9 [+/- 10.3] v 3.1 [+/- 9.59]; P = .008). The improvement in FACIT-F total quality-of-life scores was also significantly better for the dexamethasone group at day 15 (P = .03). The mean differences in the ESAS physical distress scores at day 15 were significantly better for the dexamethasone group (P = .013, respectively). No differences were observed for ESAS overall symptom distress (P = .22) or psychological distress score (P = .76). Frequency of adverse effects was not significantly different between groups (41 of 62 v 44 of 58; P = .14). CONCLUSION: Dexamethasone is more effective than placebo in improving CRF and quality of life in patients with advanced cancer.	1a
21944515	Regression does not predict nodal metastasis or survival in patients with cutaneous melanoma.	Controversy exists regarding the prognostic implications of regression in patients with cutaneous melanoma. Some consider regression to be an indication for sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy because regression may result in underestimation of the true Breslow thickness. Other data support regression as a favorable prognostic indicator, representing immune system recognition of the primary tumor. This analysis was performed to determine whether regression predicts nodal metastasis, disease-free survival (DFS), or overall survival (OS). Post hoc analysis was performed of a multicenter prospective randomized trial that included patients aged 18 to 70 years with cutaneous melanomas 1 mm or greater Breslow thickness. All patients underwent SLN biopsy; those with tumor-positive SLN underwent completion lymphadenectomy. Kaplan-Meier analysis of survival, univariate analysis, and multivariate analysis were performed. A total of 2220 patients (261 with regression; 1959 without regression) were included in this analysis with a median follow-up of 68 months. Patients with regression were more likely to be male, older than 50 years old, and have lower median Breslow thickness, superficial spreading histologic subtype, and a nonextremity anatomic location (P < 0.05 in all cases). Regression was not significantly associated with Clark level, ulceration, lymphovascular invasion, number of SLNs removed, or SLN metastasis. On multivariate analysis, factors independently predictive of DFS included Breslow thickness, ulceration, and SLN status (P < 0.05 in all cases); the same factors along with age, gender, and anatomic tumor location were significantly associated with OS (P < 0.05 in all cases). Regression was not significantly associated with DFS (risk ratio [RR], 0.94; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.67-1.27; P = 0.68) or OS (RR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.76-1.32; P = 0.93). These data suggest that regression is not a significant prognostic factor for patients with cutaneous melanoma and should not be used to guide clinical decision-making for such patients.	2b
6863069	Conventional fractionated radiotherapy for 51 patients with lentigo maligna and lentigo maligna melanoma.	Lentigo maligna (LM) and lentigo maligna melanoma (LMM) are distinct entities from other forms of melanoma, occurring predominantly on the skin of the head and neck in elderly people, having a slow growth rate and a low metastatic potential (10%). Twenty-three patients with LM were treated with conventional fractionated irradiation, 18 were locally controlled and two failed locally both of whom, however, were salvaged with further treatment. Three patients are not evaluable because of short follow-up time. Median time to complete regression of the lesion is seven months. Twenty-eight patients with LMM have been irradiated, 23 are locally controlled, two locally recurred (both retrieved with subsequent treatment), and three are inevaluable because of short follow-up time. One patient with a level 5 LMM has developed regional and distant metastases. It is concluded that irradiation is a simple effective method of treatment for this form of melanoma.	4
8690640	Initial results of a phase II trial of high dose radiation therapy, 5-fluorouracil, and cisplatin for patients with anal cancer (E4292): an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group study.	PURPOSE: A prospective clinical trial was performed to assess the response and toxicity associated with the use of high dose radiation therapy, 5-fluorouracil, and cisplatin in patients with anal cancer. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Patients with anal cancer without distant metastasis were eligible for this study. Radiation therapy consisted of 59.4 Gy in 33 fractions; a 2 week break in treatment was taken after 36 Gy had been given. A treatment of 5-fluorouracil, 1,000 mg/m2 per day intravenously, was given for the first 4 days of radiation therapy, and cisplatin, 75 mg/m2 intravenously, was given on day 1 of radiation therapy. A second course of 5-fluorouracil and cisplatin was given after 36 Gy of radiation, when the radiation therapy was resumed. RESULTS: Nineteen patients entered this study and received treatment. Thirteen (68%) had a complete response, 5 (26%) had a partial response, and 1 (5%) had stable disease. The patient with stable disease and one of the patients with a partial response had complete disappearance of tumor more than 8 weeks after completion of radiation therapy. Fifteen patients had toxicity of Grade 3 or higher: the worst toxicity was Grade 3 in eight patients, Grade 4 in six patients, and Grade 5 in one patient. The most common form of toxicity of Grade 3 or higher was hematologic. The one lethal toxicity was due to pseudomembranous colitis, which was a complication of antibiotic therapy for a urinary tract infection. CONCLUSION: Radiation therapy, cisplatin, and 5-fluorouracil resulted in an overall response rate of 95%. Significant toxicity occurred, an indication that this regimen is near the maximal tolerated dose. A Phase III clinical trial is planned in which radiation therapy, cisplatin, and 5-fluorouracil will be used as an experimental arm.	1b
21287526	Oncologic outcomes of open conservation laryngectomy for radiorecurrent laryngeal carcinoma: a systematic review and meta-analysis of English-language literature.	BACKGROUND: The role of open conservation (partial) laryngeal surgery in radiorecurrent laryngeal cancers is unclear, and the procedure is not widely accepted or practiced. The objective of this review was to assess the oncologic and functional outcomes of partial laryngectomy in radiorecurrent tumors of the larynx reported in the literature. METHODS: The systematic review was performed using independently developed search strategies and included Medline, Embase, Zetoc, conference proceedings, and, when appropriate, a manual search. Inclusion criteria for the articles were set a priori. All included articles were subjected to quality assessment. Pooled estimates of local control at 24 months and of disease-free and overall survival rates were calculated using both a fixed-effects model (inverse square) and a random-effects model (DerSimonian-Laird). RESULTS: The search identified 401 publications, of which 26 studies satisfied all inclusion criteria. Ten studies had a quality score >/=6 (good), and 16 had a score of 4 or 5 (fair). The pooled estimates of oncologic outcomes using the random-effects model were as follows: The local control rate at 24 months for 560 patients was 86.9% (95% CI, 84%-89.5%), the disease-free survival rate for 352 patients was 91.2% (95% CI, 88.2%-93.9%), and the overall survival rate for 360 patients was 83.1% (95% CI, 79.1%-86.7%). Decannulation of tracheostomy occurred in 95.1% (95% CI, 92.6%-97.2%) of the patients who were analyzed (n = 315), whereas the pooled mean larynx preservation rate was 83.9% (95% CI, 80.7%-87%; n = 502) CONCLUSIONS: The current results indicated that open partial laryngectomies are oncologically sound procedures in the salvage setting and have a high larynx preservation rate.	4
19102395	Survival benefit of pancreaticoduodenectomy in a Japanese fashion for a limited group of patients with pancreatic head cancer.	BACKGROUND/AIMS: To evaluate the clinical benefit of pancreaticoduodenectomy in a Japanese fashion for patients with pancreatic head cancer. METHODOLOGY: One hundred and one patients underwent pancreatectomy for pancreatic head cancer between 1980 and 2001. Of these, 40 patients in the extended resection (ER) group had an extended lymphadenectomy and neural plexus dissection as a Japanese fashion, while 61 patients in the conventional resection (CR) group. Tumor status, morbidity, mortality, survival and pattern of recurrence were retrospectively studied. RESULTS: The incidence of R0 operations in the ER group was higher than that in the CR group (p<0.01). The actuarial 5-year survival rate (30.6%) of patients with pStage IIA or IIB in the ER group was significantly higher than that (8.2%) in the CR group (p=0.04) because local recurrence (47%) in the CR group was higher than that (25%) in the ER group (p=0.02). In an immunohistochemical study of isolated tumor cells (ITCs), 13 patients (57%) with lymph node ITCs were included in the 23 pN0 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Pancreaticoduodenectomy in a Japanese fashion with an adequate extended resection might bring a survival benefit for patients with pStage IIA or IIB pancreatic head cancer.	4
12677264	The treatment of locally advanced pancreatic cancer: a practice guideline.	BACKGROUND: Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is the fourth most common cause of adult cancer death. About 50% of patients present with metastatic disease, 20% with resectable disease and the remaining 30% of patients are diagnosed with incurable, locally advanced unresectable but nonmetastatic pancreatic cancer. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the current evidence regarding treatment of incurable, locally advanced, unresectable but nonmetastatic pancreatic cancer and produce an evidence-based practice guideline. METHODS: A systematic review of the literature was performed. The MEDLINE, CANCERLIT, and Cochrane Library databases were searched using the following medical subject heading search terms: 'pancreatic neoplasms', 'chemotherapy, adjuvant', 'radiotherapy', 'immunotherapy', combined with the text words: 'chemotherapy', 'radiotherapy', 'radiation', 'immunotherapy', combined with terms for the following study designs or publication types: practice guidelines, meta-analyses and randomized controlled trials. The Physician Data Query clinical trials database and the proceedings of the annual meetings of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (1996 to 2001) and the American Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology (1999 to 2001) were searched for reports of new or ongoing trials. Relevant literature was selected and reviewed independently, and the reference lists from these sources were searched for additional trials. Interpretation of evidence was resolved by consensus. RESULTS: Eight randomized trials were obtained that met the inclusion criteria. CONCLUSIONS: Recommendations are to offer combined chemotherapy and radiotherapy to suitable patients. The preferred chemotherapeutic agent to combine with radiotherapy is bolus or infusional 5-fluorouracil, but the optimal mode and duration of 5-fluorouracil delivery is unclear. Chemotherapy alone with gem-citabine is an acceptable alternative.	1a
15826747	Negative prostatic biopsies in patients with a high risk of prostate cancer. Is the combination of endorectal MRI and magnetic resonance spectroscopy imaging (MRSI) a useful tool? A preliminary study.	OBJECTIVE: Repeated biopsies in patients with a high risk of prostate cancer only allow a small proportion of new cancer diagnosis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of combined MRI and magnetic resonance spectroscopy imaging (MRSI) for these patients. METHODS: Between April 2003 and April 2004, 42 patients with negative multiple cores prostatic biopsies and serum PSA>4 ng/ml underwent a combined MRI/MRSI analysis. Suspicious zones on standard MRI included low intensity signals on T2 weighted images. A high choline+creatine-to-citrate ratio defined a MRSI suspicious zone. A 10 cores following peripheral biopsy scheme was done to which were added supplementary biopsies on the MRI/MRSI suspicious zones. RESULTS: The mean age was 62.3 years (51-74), the mean pre-biopsy serum PSA was 12 (3.87-35), the mean free/total PSA ratio was 11% (5-20). The mean number of previous prostate biopsy rounds was 2.04. 15 prostate cancers were diagnosed (35.7%). In 9 cases, abnormal MRI/MRSI findings and positive biopsy sites were located on the same prostatic zones. In 5 cases, MRSI alone located the positive biopsy zones. Sensitivity of combined MRI/MRSI in this study was 73.3%; specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and accuracy were 96.3%, 91.6%, 86.6% and 88% respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This preliminary study shows that the combination of MRI and MRSI might be able to guide and therefore limit the number of iterative biopsies and cores for patients who are at high risk of having a prostate cancer. In some cases, MRSI alone allows identification of neoplasic prostatic zones. Other studies are needed to confirm these data.	2b
19328650	Acupressure bands are effective in reducing radiation therapy-related nausea.	Previous studies have shown that acupressure bands can reduce chemotherapy-related nausea. Patients' expectations of efficacy account for part of this outcome. We conducted a three-arm randomized clinical trial to investigate the effectiveness of acupressure bands in controlling radiation therapy-induced nausea and to test whether an informational manipulation designed to increase expectation of efficacy would enhance the effectiveness of the acupressure bands. Patients who experienced nausea at prior treatments were randomized to either standard care (Arm 1, n=29) or standard care plus acupressure bands with either neutral (Arm 2, n=30) or positive (Arm 3, n=29) information regarding the efficacy of the bands. Patients reported nausea for two days prior to randomization (baseline) and for five days following using a seven-point semantic rating scale (1=not nauseated to 7=extremely nauseated). Patients in Arms 2 and 3 combined reported greater reduction in average nausea than patients in Arm 1 (P=0.01; mean(bands)=0.70, mean(no bands)=0.10). This equates to a 23.8% decrease in nausea in the band groups compared to a 4.8% decrease in the control group, a 19% difference. The informational manipulation failed to alter efficacy expectations and there was no statistically significant difference in nausea between patients in Arms 2 and 3. Acupressure bands are an effective, low-cost, nonintrusive, well-accepted, and safe adjunct to standard antiemetic medication. An attempt to boost the efficacy of the acupressure bands by providing positive information was not successful.	2b
20471543	Morphine versus midazolam as upfront therapy to control dyspnea perception in cancer patients while its underlying cause is sought or treated.	CONTEXT: Cancer patients with dyspnea may be able to have the symptom pharmacologically controlled while its underlying cause is sought or treated. OBJECTIVES: This study was done to determine whether symptom control can be achieved while the cause is evaluated or treated and whether morphine or midazolam would be more suitable in this setting. METHODS: Sixty-three ambulatory patients with advanced cancer and dyspnea were clinically characterized and then randomized to receive either oral morphine or oral midazolam. A fast in-clinic drug titration scheme was implemented followed by an ambulatory five-day period in which the patients received the effective dose that relieved their dyspnea. During this period, the patients were followed daily while the underlying causes of dyspnea were sought out or treated. RESULTS: Thirty-one patients with dyspnea entered the morphine arm and 32 patients entered the midazolam one. During the initial in-clinic phase, dyspnea was alleviated by at least 50% in all patients, whether they received morphine or midazolam. During the ambulatory phase, midazolam was superior to morphine in controlling baseline and breakthrough dyspnea. Both treatments were well tolerated, with mild somnolence being the most common adverse event. Neither morphine nor midazolam affected the outcome and/or implementation of additional diagnostic and/or therapeutic interventions. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that cancer-related dyspnea in ambulatory patients can be pharmacologically treated while its most probable specific cause is sought and/or while an etiology-oriented intervention is implemented. In this setting, midazolam appeared to be a better option than morphine for the immediate and long-term relief of the symptom.	1a
19897418	Radiotherapy plus cetuximab for locoregionally advanced head and neck cancer: 5-year survival data from a phase 3 randomised trial, and relation between cetuximab-induced rash and survival.	BACKGROUND: Previous results from our phase 3 randomised trial showed that adding cetuximab to primary radiotherapy increased overall survival in patients with locoregionally advanced squamous-cell carcinoma of the head and neck (LASCCHN) at 3 years. Here we report the 5-year survival data, and investigate the relation between cetuximab-induced rash and survival. METHODS: Patients with LASCCHN of the oropharynx, hypopharynx, or larynx with measurable disease were randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to receive either comprehensive head and neck radiotherapy alone for 6-7 weeks or radiotherapy plus weekly doses of cetuximab: 400 mg/m(2) initial dose, followed by seven weekly doses at 250 mg/m(2). Randomisation was done with an adaptive minimisation technique to balance assignments across stratification factors of Karnofsky performance score, T stage, N stage, and radiation fractionation. The trial was un-blinded. The primary endpoint was locoregional control, with a secondary endpoint of survival. Following discussions with the US Food and Drug Administration, the dataset was locked, except for queries to the sites about overall survival, before our previous report in 2006, so that an independent review could be done. Analyses were done on an intention-to-treat basis. Following completion of treatment, patients underwent physical examination and radiographic imaging every 4 months for 2 years, and then every 6 months thereafter. The trial is registered at www.ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00004227. FINDINGS: Patients were randomly assigned to receive radiotherapy with (n=211) or without (n=213) cetuximab, and all patients were followed for survival. Updated median overall survival for patients treated with cetuximab and radiotherapy was 49.0 months (95% CI 32.8-69.5) versus 29.3 months (20.6-41.4) in the radiotherapy-alone group (hazard ratio [HR] 0.73, 95% CI 0.56-0.95; p=0.018). 5-year overall survival was 45.6% in the cetuximab-plus-radiotherapy group and 36.4% in the radiotherapy-alone group. Additionally, for the patients treated with cetuximab, overall survival was significantly improved in those who experienced an acneiform rash of at least grade 2 severity compared with patients with no rash or grade 1 rash (HR 0.49, 0.34-0.72; p=0.002). INTERPRETATION: For patients with LASCCHN, cetuximab plus radiotherapy significantly improves overall survival at 5 years compared with radiotherapy alone, confirming cetuximab plus radiotherapy as an important treatment option in this group of patients. Cetuximab-treated patients with prominent cetuximab-induced rash (grade 2 or above) have better survival than patients with no or grade 1 rash.

17416863	Palliative radiotherapy trials for bone metastases: a systematic review.	PURPOSE: The objective is to update previous meta-analyses with a systematic review of randomized palliative radiotherapy (RT) trials comparing single fractions (SFs) versus multiple fractions (MFs). METHODS: The analysis includes all published reports from randomized trials comparing SF or MF schedules for the treatment of painful bone metastases with localized RT. A systematic review was performed using the random-effects model with Review Manager version 4.1 (Cochrane Collaboration, Oxford, UK). The odds ratio and 95% CI were calculated for each trial and presented in a forest plot. RESULTS: A total of 16 randomized trials from 1986 onward were identified. For intention-to-treat patients, the overall response (OR) rates for pain were similar for SF at 1,468 (58%) of 2,513 patients and MF RT at 1,466 (59%) of 2,487 patients. The complete response (CR) rates for pain were 23% (545 of 2,375 patients) for SF and 24% (558 of 2,351 patients) for MF RT. No significant differences were found in response rates. Trends showing an increased risk for SF RT arm patients in terms of pathological fractures and spinal cord compressions were observed, but neither were statistically significant (P = .75 and P = .13, respectively). The likelihood of re-treatment was 2.5-fold higher (95% CI, 1.76 to 3.56) in SF RT arm patients (P < .00001). Repeated analysis of these end points, excluding dropout patients, did not alter the conclusions. Generally, no significant differences with respect to acute toxicities were observed between the arms. CONCLUSION: No significant differences in the arms were observed for overall and CR rates in both intention-to-treat and assessable patients. However, a significantly higher re-treatment rate with SFs was evident.	1a
16014595	Improving the use of hospice services in nursing homes: a randomized controlled trial.	CONTEXT: Hospice care may improve the quality of end-of-life care for nursing home residents, but hospice is underutilized by this population, at least in part because physicians are not aware of their patients' preferences. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether it is possible to increase hospice utilization and improve the quality of end-of-life care by identifying residents whose goals and preferences are consistent with hospice care. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Randomized controlled trial (December 2003-December 2004) of nursing home residents and their surrogate decision makers (N=205) in 3 US nursing homes. INTERVENTION: A structured interview identified residents whose goals for care, treatment preferences, and palliative care needs made them appropriate for hospice care. These residents' physicians were notified and asked to authorize a hospice informational visit. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome measures were (1) hospice enrollment within 30 days of the intervention and (2) families' ratings of the quality of care for residents who died during the 6-month follow-up period. RESULTS: Of the 205 residents in the study sample, 107 were randomly assigned to receive the intervention, and 98 received usual care. Intervention residents were more likely than usual care residents to enroll in hospice within 30 days (21/107 [20%] vs 1/98 [1%]; P<.001 [Fisher exact test]) and to enroll in hospice during the follow-up period (27/207 [25%] vs 6/98 [6%]; P<.001). Intervention residents had fewer acute care admissions (mean: 0.28 vs 0.49; P = .04 [Wilcoxon rank sum test]) and spent fewer days in an acute care setting (mean: 1.2 vs 3.0; P = .03 [Wilcoxon rank sum test]). Families of intervention residents rated the resident's care more highly than did families of usual care residents (mean on a scale of 1-5: 4.1 vs 2.5; P = .04 [Wilcoxon rank sum test]). CONCLUSION: A simple communication intervention can increase rates of hospice referrals and families' ratings of end-of-life care and may also decrease utilization of acute care resources.	1a
20619933	Benefit and harm of iodine in wound care: a systematic review.	Nowadays many products are available to combat infections and thus to promote wound healing. Iodine is one of these products, but reports are conflicting as to the effectiveness and adverse effects of iodine in the treatment of wounds. A systematic review was performed of 27 randomised clinical trials, reporting on chronic, acute, burn wounds, pressure sores, and skin grafts. Main outcome parameters were wound healing, bacterial count, and adverse effects. Iodine did not lead to a reduction or prolongation of wound-healing time compared with other (antiseptic) wound dressings or agents. In individual trials, iodine was significantly superior to other antiseptic agents (such as silver sulfadiazine cream) and non-antiseptic dressings, but seemed inferior to a local antibiotic (Rifamycin SV MMX((R))) and, when combined with alcohol, to crude honey in reducing bacterial count and/or wound size. Adverse effects, including thyroid function derailment, did not occur more frequently with iodine. Based on the available evidence from clinical trials, iodine is an effective antiseptic agent that shows neither the purported harmful effects nor a delay of the wound-healing process, particularly in chronic and burn wounds. The antiseptic effect of iodine is not inferior to that of other (antiseptic) agents and does not impair wound healing. Hence, iodine deserves to retain its place among the modern antiseptic agents.	1a
24781816	Does metastasectomy improve survival in skeletal melanoma?	UNLABELLED: Melanoma metastatic to bone carries a poor prognosis with overall median survival in the 4-6 months range. Others have published data that suggest resection of isolated visceral organ metastases improves survival. We conducted a retrospective analysis of 130 cases of stage IV melanoma with pathologically confirmed bony disease. We used Cox regression survival analysis to compare a group of patients who underwent wide resection of metastases with those who received other surgery or were treated nonoperatively. We also compared the three groups against matched historical stage IV melanoma controls to determine differences between expected and observed 1-year overall survival. Median overall survival for the nonoperative (N=80), intralesional (N=32), and resection (N=18) groups was 4.8, 5.1, and 11.8 months, respectively. Cox regression survival analysis confirmed the overall survival benefit resulting from wide resection (hazard ratio 0.53) after correcting for independent predictors of worse survival, such as pathologic spinal compression fracture (hazard ratio 1.68). The observed 1-year overall survival rate in the resection group was nearly double that of matched historical controls (50.0 vs. 24.8%). We present the largest known series of bony melanoma, along with data which suggest that overall survival may be improved in carefully selected patients where all known macroscopic disease can be resected. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: level III.	3a
19616743	Higher-than-conventional radiation doses in localized prostate cancer treatment: a meta-analysis of randomized, controlled trials.	PURPOSE: To determine in a meta-analysis whether the outcomes in men with localized prostate cancer treated with high-dose radiotherapy (HDRT) are better than those in men treated with conventional-dose radiotherapy (CDRT), by quantifying the effect of the total dose of radiotherapy on biochemical control (BC). METHODS AND MATERIALS: The MEDLINE, EMBASE, CANCERLIT, and Cochrane Library databases, as well as the proceedings of annual meetings, were systematically searched to identify randomized, controlled studies comparing HDRT with CDRT for localized prostate cancer. To evaluate the dose-response relationship, we conducted a meta-regression analysis of BC ratios by means of weighted linear regression. RESULTS: Seven RCTs with a total patient population of 2812 were identified that met the study criteria. Pooled results from these RCTs showed a significant reduction in the incidence of biochemical failure in those patients with prostate cancer treated with HDRT (p < 0.0001). However, there was no difference in the mortality rate (p = 0.38) and specific prostate cancer mortality rates (p = 0.45) between the groups receiving HDRT and CDRT. However, there were more cases of late Grade >2 gastrointestinal toxicity after HDRT than after CDRT. In the subgroup analysis, patients classified as being at low (p = 0.007), intermediate (p < 0.0001), and high risk (p < 0.0001) of biochemical failure all showed a benefit from HDRT. The meta-regression analysis also detected a linear correlation between the total dose of radiotherapy and biochemical failure (BC = -67.3 + [1.8 x radiotherapy total dose in Gy]; p = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Our meta-analysis showed that HDRT is superior to CDRT in preventing biochemical failure in low-, intermediate-, and high-risk prostate cancer patients, suggesting that this should be offered as a treatment for all patients, regardless of their risk status.	1a
17105798	Effect of testosterone replacement therapy on prostate tissue in men with late-onset hypogonadism: a randomized controlled trial.	CONTEXT: Prostate safety is a primary concern when aging men receive testosterone replacement therapy (TRT), but little information is available regarding the effects of TRT on prostate tissue in men. OBJECTIVE: To determine the effects of TRT on prostate tissue of aging men with low serum testosterone levels. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 44 men, aged 44 to 78 years, with screening serum testosterone levels lower than 300 ng/dL (<10.4 nmol/L) and related symptoms, conducted at a US community-based research center between February 2003 and November 2004. INTERVENTION: Participants were randomly assigned to receive 150 mg of testosterone enanthate or matching placebo intramuscularly every 2 weeks for 6 months. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome measure was the 6-month change in prostate tissue androgen levels (testosterone and dihydrotestosterone). Secondary outcome measures included 6-month changes in prostate-related clinical features, histology, biomarkers, and epithelial cell gene expression. RESULTS: Of the 44 men randomized, 40 had prostate biopsies performed both at baseline and at 6 months and qualified for per-protocol analysis (TRT, n = 21; placebo, n = 19). Testosterone replacement therapy increased serum testosterone levels to the mid-normal range (median at baseline, 282 ng/dL [9.8 nmol/L]; median at 6 months, 640 ng/dL [22.2 nmol/L]) with no significant change in serum testosterone levels in matched, placebo-treated men. However, median prostate tissue levels of testosterone (0.91 ng/g) and dihydrotestosterone (6.79 ng/g) did not change significantly in the TRT group. No treatment-related change was observed in prostate histology, tissue biomarkers (androgen receptor, Ki-67, CD34), gene expression (including AR, PSA, PAP2A, VEGF, NXK3, CLU [Clusterin]), or cancer incidence or severity. Treatment-related changes in prostate volume, serum prostate-specific antigen, voiding symptoms, and urinary flow were minor. CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary data suggest that in aging men with late-onset hypogonadism, 6 months of TRT normalizes serum androgen levels but appears to have little effect on prostate tissue androgen levels and cellular functions. Establishment of prostate safety for large populations of older men undergoing longer duration of TRT requires further study. Trial Registration clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00161304.	1b
28241191	A Large Skin Cancer Screening Quality Initiative: Description and First-Year Outcomes.	"IMPORTANCE: The lack of prospective randomized clinical trials demonstrating that full-body skin examination (FBSE) reduces melanoma morbidity or mortality has prompted an ""I"" rating from the United States Preventive Services Task Force for population-based skin cancer screening. More data on these screening programs are needed. OBJECTIVES: To describe a skin cancer screening quality initiative in a large health care system and to determine if the intervention was associated with screening of a demographically higher-risk population than previous screening programs and if melanoma incidence and thickness differed in screened vs unscreened patients. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This observational evaluation of a prospectively implemented quality initiative was conducted in a large health care system in western Pennsylvania (University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, UPMC) among adults seen in an office visit by a UPMC-employed primary care physician (PCP) in 2014. INTERVENTIONS: Implementation of a campaign promoting annual skin cancer screening by FBSE, including training of PCPs, promotion of the initiative to physicians and patients, and modification of the electronic health record (EHR) to include FBSE as a recommended preventive service for patients 35 years or older. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Characteristics of screened and unscreened patients and melanomas detected among them. RESULTS: Of 333735 adult patients seen in an office visit by PCPs in 2014, 53196 patients (15.9% of the screen-eligible population) received an FBSE, and 280539 did not. Screened patients were slightly older (median age, 60 vs 57 years; P < .001) but did not differ significantly by sex (43.2% vs 43.1% men; P = .49) from the unscreened population. Fifty melanomas were diagnosed in screened patients and 104 melanomas were diagnosed in unscreened patients. Screened patients were more likely than unscreened patients to be diagnosed with melanoma (adjusted risk ratio [RR], 2.4; 95% CI, 1.7-3.4; P < .001) and to have a thinner invasive melanoma (median thickness, 0.37 mm vs 0.65 mm; P < .001). The incidence of melanoma lesions 1 mm or thicker was similar in screened vs unscreened patients (adjusted RR, 0.7; 95% CI, 02.-2.2; P = .52). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Large-scale screening for melanoma within a United States health care system is feasible and can result in increased detection of thinner melanomas. This intervention also resulted in screening of a higher proportion of men and an older patient population than previous screening interventions in which younger individuals and women predominated."	2a
22968365	[Treatment of nausea and vomiting with prokinetics and neuroleptics in palliative care patients : a review].	"BACKGROUND: Many recommendations concerning the treatment of nausea and vomiting in palliative care patients exist but what is the evidence for this? Most studies dealing with this topic have focused on cancer patients under chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy or on patients with postoperative nausea. Cancer patients without chemotherapy or radiation therapy, patients without postoperative nausea, and patients having other diseases with palliative care aspects, such as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), progressive heart failure, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and multiple sclerosis (MS) have been underrepresented in studies on nausea and vomiting so far. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this review was to determine the level of evidence for the treatment of nausea and vomiting with prokinetics and neuroleptics in palliative care patients suffering from far advanced cancer and no longer being treated with chemotherapy or radiation therapy, AIDS, COPD, progressive heart failure, ALS or MS. METHODS: Two different electronic databases (PubMed und Embase) were used to identify studies. Furthermore, a hand search for related articles was performed. No restriction was made concerning study types. Studies with patients undergoing chemotherapy radiation therapy or suffering from postoperative nausea, pediatric studies and studies published neither in English nor in German were excluded. RESULTS: A total of 30 studies fulfilling the inclusion criteria were found. All studies focused on cancer patients. Despite intensive research studies in patients with AIDS, COPD, heart failure, ALS or MS were not detected. Metoclopramide is seen as an effective drug in many studies whereas the evidence for it is moderate at best. Within the group of neuroleptics, levosupiride and levomepromazine seem to have good antiemetic potential but the evidence level is low. CONCLUSION: In patients with advanced cancer not being treated with chemotherapy or radiation therapy, metoclopramide can be used to reduce nausea and vomiting. Neuroleptics, such as levosulpiride or levomepromazine are alternatives but their adverse effects have to be considered carefully. The evidence level for prokinetics and neuroleptics is moderate to low. Concerning palliative care of patients with diseases other than cancer no studies exist. More well designed studies in palliative care patients are needed in order to facilitate evidence based antiemetic therapy. The English full text version of this article will be available in SpringerLink as of November 2012 (under ""Supplemental"")."	1a
26260726	The effect of melatonin on sleep and quality of life in patients with advanced breast cancer.	BACKGROUND: Fatigue and sleep problems are prevalent in cancer patients and can be associated with disruption of circadian rhythmicity. In this prospective phase II trial, we sought to assess the effect of melatonin on circadian biomarkers, sleep, and quality of life in breast cancer patients. METHODS: Thirty-two patients with metastatic breast cancer, receiving hormonal or trastuzumab therapy, took 5 mg of melatonin at bedtime for 2 months. Before starting and after 2 months on melatonin therapy, sleep and circadian rhythmicity were assessed by actigraphy, diurnal patterns of serum cortisol, and the expression of the core clock genes PER2 and BMAL1 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-C30 questionnaire was completed for subjective parameters. RESULTS: Bedtime melatonin was associated with a significant improvement in a marker of objective sleep quality, sleep fragmentation and quantity, subjective sleep, fatigue severity, global quality of life, and social and cognitive functioning scales. Morning clock gene expression was increased following bedtime melatonin intake. Melatonin did not affect actigraphy measure of circadian rhythmicity, or the diurnal cortisol pattern. CONCLUSION: These results invite further investigation of melatonin as a potentially useful therapeutic agent for improving sleep and quality of life in cancer patients.	3a
16713065	Management and survival of screen-detected prostate cancer patients who might have been suitable for active surveillance.	OBJECTIVE: Screening practices for prostate cancer have resulted in an increasing incidence of prostate cancers. Our knowledge about which prostate cancers are life threatening and which are not is limited. Thus, for ethical, medical, and economic reasons we need to define which patients can be managed by active surveillance. METHODS: From 1993 through 1999, men from the Rotterdam section of the European Randomized study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC) were screened by two strict protocols, which were based on prostate-specific antigen (PSA), digital rectal examination, and transrectal ultrasound. For this study, men with criteria that reflect current active surveillance studies were selected: those with a biopsy Gleason score < or =3+3 in two or fewer cores, with a PSA density <0.2 and a maximum PSA-level of 15 ng/ml. Clinical stage had to be T1C or T2. RESULTS: Of the 1,014 prostate cancers detected in the prevalence screen, 293 men (28.9%) met the criteria for active surveillance. Their mean age was 65.7 and the mean PSA level was 4.8 ng/ml. Radical prostatectomy was elected by 136 men (46.4%), radiotherapy by 91 (31.1%), and watchful waiting by 64 (21.8%). The mean follow-up was 80.8 months. The eight-year prostate cancer-specific survival was 99.2%; the overall survival was 85.4%. Nineteen men who chose watchful waiting changed to definitive treatment during follow-up. CONCLUSION: Only three men died of prostate cancer, none of whom were on watchful waiting. Our observations provide preliminary validation of the arbitrary selection criteria for active surveillance.	3a
28026855	Does hormonal therapy for fertility preservation affect the survival of young women with early-stage endometrial cancer?	BACKGROUND: The incidence of endometrial cancer among young women is increasing. Some patients with low-grade endometrial cancer receive hormone therapy (HT) before surgery to preserve fertility. It is unclear whether this adversely affects survival. METHODS: Patients with localized, low-grade endometrial cancer who were aged <45 years were selected from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database between 1993 and 2012. Propensity score matching was used to select comparable groups receiving HT or primary surgery. Cancer-specific and overall survival were measured using Kaplan-Meier methods. Hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were estimated using Cox models adjusted for age, period of diagnosis, marital status, race, tumor grade, morphology, and previous radiotherapy. RESULTS: A total of 6339 women were included in the current study cohort, 161 of whom initially received HT and 6178 of whom received primary surgery. After 15 years of follow-up, all-cause mortality did not differ between the groups (HT group: 14.1% [95% CI, 6.7%-28.4%] and propensity score-matched primary surgery group: 9.3% [95% CI, 4.1%-20.5%]). Cancer-specific mortality appeared higher in patients treated with HT compared with those treated with primary surgery (9.2% [95% CI, 3.4%-24.0%] vs 2.1% [95% CI, 1.5%-2.8%]). However, this difference was driven by 3 late deaths in the HT group. Sensitivity analyses using a broader definition of cancer-specific mortality provided no statistical evidence of a survival difference between the treatment groups. The hazard ratio for the overall risk of death was 1.45 (95% CI, 0.44-4.74). CONCLUSIONS: Based on this population-based cohort, young patients with low-grade endometrial cancer appear to have excellent survival, regardless of the primary therapy chosen (HT vs primary surgery). The current selection of patients for HT to preserve fertility, which is managed carefully by experienced clinicians, does not appear to significantly worsen clinical outcomes.

20180240	Prognosis and feasibility of en-bloc vascular resection in stage II pancreatic adenocarcinoma.	AIM: To establish the prognosis and feasibility of en-bloc vascular resection of stage II pancreatic adenocarcinoma of the head and uncinate process. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 87 patients with stage II pancreatic adenocarcinoma, who were subjected to pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) and pylorus-preserving PD (PPPD) between 1996 and 2006 in Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taiwan. Twelve and 75 patients underwent PD/PPPD with and without resection of portal vein/superior mesenteric vein (PV/SMV), respectively. RESULTS: The overall 1- and 3-year survival rates of patients undergoing PD/PPPD with and without vascular resection were 50.0% and 16.7%, and 44.4% and 12.2%, respectively. Morbidity and mortality rates in the PV/SMV resection vs non-resection group were 50.0% and 0.0%, and 40.0% and 2.7%, respectively. In multivariate analysis, serum bilirubin, histological differentiation and adjuvant chemotherapy were independent prognostic factors that influenced survival. CONCLUSION: In stage II adenocarcinoma of the pancreatic head and uncinate process, serum bilirubin, histological differentiation and adjuvant chemotherapy were independent prognostic factors, and en-bloc vascular resection is a feasible option in carefully selected patients.	2b
19289630	Phase III study of gefitinib compared with intravenous methotrexate for recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck [corrected].	PURPOSE: To compare survival in patients with recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) treated with gefitinib 250 or 500 mg/day or standard methotrexate. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Four hundred eighty-six patients with recurrent SCCHN were randomly assigned to oral gefitinib 250 mg/day, gefitinib 500 mg/day, or methotrexate 40 mg/m(2) intravenously weekly. Primary end point was overall survival, secondary end points were objective response rate (ORR), safety, symptom improvement, and quality of life (QOL). Exploratory end points included association of efficacy with epidermal growth factor receptor gene copy number and other biomarkers. RESULTS: Neither gefitinib 250 nor 500 mg/day improved overall survival compared with methotrexate (hazard ratio [HR], 1.22; 95% CI, 0.95 to 1.57; P = .12; and HR, 1.12; 95% CI, 0.87 to 1.43; P = .39, respectively). In the gefitinib 250 mg/day, 500 mg/day, and methotrexate groups, respectively, median overall survival was 5.6, 6.0, and 6.7 months; ORRs (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors) were 2.7%, 7.6% and 3.9%, with no statistically significant difference between either gefitinib arm and methotrexate. No unexpected adverse events were observed, except for tumor hemorrhage-type events with gefitinib (8.9%, gefitinib 250 mg/day; 11.4%, gefitinib 500 mg/day; 1.9%, methotrexate). QOL improvement rates (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Head & Neck total score) were 13.4%, 18.0%, and 6.0% for gefitinib 250 mg/day, 500 mg/day, and methotrexate, respectively. CONCLUSION: In patients with recurrent or metastatic SCCHN, while responses with gefitinib were seen, neither gefitinib 250 nor 500 mg/day improved overall survival compared with methotrexate. With the exception of tumor hemorrhage-type events with gefitinib, the adverse event profiles were generally consistent with those previously observed.	2b
16130134	Risk-group definition by recursive partitioning analysis of patients with squamous cell head and neck carcinoma treated with surgery and postoperative radiotherapy.	BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to define different prognostic groups with regard to locoregional control (LRC) derived from recursive partitioning analysis (RPA). METHODS: Eight hundred one patients with squamous cell head and neck carcinoma underwent with primary surgery and received postoperative radiotherapy. For the definition of prognostic groups, the method of classification and regression trees was performed, including a large number of well known prognostic factors. RESULTS: The final model was composed of six prognostic factors for LRC, resulting in seven terminal nodes. RPA Class I (intermediate risk) consisted of 381 patients who had no N3 lymph nodes, free surgical margins (> 5 mm), and no extranodal spread (ENS). RPA Class II (high risk) consisted of 189 patients who had 1 positive lymph node with ENS or had T1, T2, or T4 tumors with close or positive surgical margins. RPA Class III (very high risk) consisted of 231 patients who had a N3 neck, > or = 2 positive lymph nodes with ENS, or a T3 tumor with close or positive surgical margins. The 5-year LRC rate was 88%, 73% and 58%, in RPA Class I, II, and III, respectively (P < 0.0001). The hazard ratio (HR) relative to RPA Class I was 2.3 (95% confidence interval [95%CI], 1.5-3.6) for RPA Class II and 4.2 (95%CI, 2.8-6.1) for RPA Class III. CONCLUSIONS: The RPA classification scheme studied allowed for the clear definition of three prognostic groups with regard to LRC and OS. These groups may be useful in the design of future prospective, randomized studies investigating new treatment modalities.	4
21499123	Health-related quality of life before and during adjuvant interferon-alpha treatment for patients with malignant melanoma (DeCOG-trial).	Adjuvant treatment with interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) for patients with malignant melanoma can improve relapse-free and overall survival, but IFN-associated side effects may reduce patient's quality of life. The aim of the study was to prospectively evaluate health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in patients with melanoma before and during Low-Dose IFN-alpha therapy. In a prospective multicenter trial conducted by the Dermatologic Cooperative Oncology Group, 850 patients with cutaneous stage II malignant melanoma received a standard Low-Dose of IFN-alpha-2a. We evaluated HRQoL using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Core 30 questionnaire at baseline and after 3, 6, and 12 months of IFN-alpha treatment in 282 patients. Nine of 15 subscales showed significant poorer results after 3 months of adjuvant IFN treatment. Symptoms included reduced physical functioning, reduced cognitive functioning, fatigue, nausea, pain, dyspnea, insomnia, diarrhea, and loss of appetite. We did not find a significant change over time for role, emotional, or social functioning. Only cognitive functioning and dyspnea continuously worsened through the twelfth month. At baseline women had significantly lower scores for physical and emotional functioning and for fatigue compared with men. During treatment, women scored significantly poorer on physical functioning, emotional functioning, fatigue, pain, and constipation subscales. Patients who reported having a bad or very bad QoL before treatment were 5.8 times more likely to discontinue treatment early because of psychiatric problems. We conclude that adjuvant low-dose IFN treatment is associated with significant deterioration of HRQoL. Specific psychosocial care should be offered especially for patients who report lower HRQoL and emotional problems before treatment to prevent early discontinuation.	1b
20800862	Surveillance after surgical treatment of melanoma: futility of routine chest radiography.	"BACKGROUND: Current recommendations by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network and other groups suggest that follow-up of cutaneous melanoma may include chest radiography (CXR) at 6- to 12-month intervals. The aim of this study was to determine the clinical efficacy of routine CXR for recurrence surveillance in melanoma. METHODS: Post hoc analysis was performed on data from a prospective, randomized, multi-institutional study on melanoma >/=1.0 mm in Breslow thickness. All patients underwent excision of the primary melanoma and sentinel node biopsy with completion lymphadenectomy for positive sentinel nodes. Yearly CXR and clinical assessments were obtained during follow-up. Results of routine CXR were compared with clinical disease states over the course of the study. RESULTS: A total of 1,235 patients were included in the analysis over a median follow-up of 74 months (range, 12-138). Overall, 210 patients (17.0%) had a recurrence, most commonly local or in-transit. Review of CXR results showed that 4,218 CXR were obtained in 1,235 patients either before, or in the absence of, initial recurrence. To date, 88% (n = 3,722) CXR are associated with no evidence of recurrence. Of CXR associated with recurrence, only 7.7% (n = 38) of surveillance CXR were read as ""abnormal."" Overall, 99% (n = 4,180) of CXR were read as either ""normal"" or found to be falsely positive (read as ""abnormal,"" but without evidence of recurrence on investigation). Only 0.9% (n = 38) of all CXR obtained were true positives (""abnormal"" CXR, with confirmed first known recurrence). Among these 38 patients with true positive CXR, 35 revealed widely disseminated disease (multiorgan or bilateral pulmonary metastases); only 3 (0.2%) had isolated pulmonary metastases amenable to resection. Sensitivity and specificity for surveillance CXR in detecting initial recurrence were 7.7% and 96.5%, respectively. CONCLUSION: The routine use of surveillance CXR provides no clinically useful information in the follow-up of patients with melanoma. CXR does not detect recurrence at levels sufficient to justify its routine use and, therefore, cannot be recommended as part of the standard surveillance regimen for these patients."	2b
18194712	Focal cryosurgery followed by penile rehabilitation as primary treatment for localized prostate cancer: initial results.	The study reported here was undertaken to assess medium short-term efficacy of focal cryoablation as primary therapy for localized prostate cancer and to determine the rate of morbidity in patients who undergo this treatment. Patients were treated with focal cryoablation with argon cryoprobes under ultrasonographic visualization with temperature monitoring. Men who were potent at the time of intervention were encouraged to use a vacuum erectile dysfunction device on a regular basis after treatment. Incontinence was defined as any urine leakage regardless of the number of pads worn (if any). Potency was defined as the ability to achieve an erection sufficient to complete intercourse with or without oral pharmaceuticals. Biochemical failure was defined as 3 successive rises in serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) concentration. A total of 60 consecutive patients were treated. Mean patient age was 69.0 years; mean PSA was 7.2 ng/mL, median Gleason score was 6, and median stage was T1c. Before treatment was initiated, all patients were continent and 72.7% were potent. Mean follow-up for the entire population was 15.2+/-7.4 months. Of those patients who were continent before receiving treatment, 3.6% were incontinent at 6 months, but none used any absorbent pads. At last follow-up, 80.4% of patients were biochemically disease free; mean time to failure was 3.5 months among those for whom treatment failed. The positive biopsy rate after first treatment was 23.3%, and mean time to failure was 12.0 months. Of those who underwent a second focal cryoablation procedure after positive biopsy, 66% were subsequently cancer free. All patients who were potent after the first cryoablation procedure regained their potency after the second cryoablation procedure. Focal cryoablation combined with penile rehabilitation as primary treatment for localized prostate cancer is a minimally morbid procedure with acceptable morbidity and the potential for retreatment of a patient if cancer is subsequently detected. Further study is warranted.	3a
11095406	Significance of serum protein S100 levels in screening for melanoma metastasis: does protein S100 enable early detection of melanoma recurrence?	A number of recent reports suggest serum protein S100 as a prognostic parameter in patients with metastatic melanoma. In the present study, serum protein S100 was investigated as a tumour marker for screening for melanoma metastasis in patients attending regular follow-up examinations. During the period from September 1997 to December 1998, serum protein S100 levels were measured by an immunoluminometric assay in 411 consecutive high risk melanoma patients (666 samples) and in 120 control subjects. Melanoma patients with resected primary tumours with a tumour thickness of 1.5 mm or more with resected metastasis were included in the study. Overall, 41 of the 411 patients developed metastasis during the period of observation. According to the distribution of protein S100 levels, the following different cut-off values were examined: 0.08 microg/l (95 percentile of the control group) and 0.13 microg/l (95 percentile of the group of melanoma patients without metastasis). The test efficiency for protein S100 as a diagnostic test for the detection of metastasis was highest for the cut-off value of 0.13 microg/l. In eight of the 41 patients (19.5%), elevation of protein S100 was the first sign of recurrence. Of the 41 patients with metastatic disease, 13 had elevated protein S100, giving a sensitivity of 0.32. The specificity for the detection of metastasis was 0.96. In eight of the 14 patients (57%) who developed distant metastasis, elevated S100 values were the first sign of tumour progression. In conclusion, determination of serum protein S100 levels enables earlier detection of distant metastasis in patients at high risk for metastasis. The impact on survival time needs to be investigated in follow-up studies.	2b
25889313	Randomized clinical trial comparing octreotide and scopolamine butylbromide in symptom control of patients with inoperable bowel obstruction due to advanced ovarian cancer.	BACKGROUND: The aim of this randomized controlled study was to determine whether octreotide (OCT) or scopolamine butylbromide (SB) was the more effective antisecretive drug controlling gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms due to malignant bowel obstruction (MBO) caused by advanced ovarian cancer. METHODS: Ninety-seven advanced ovarian cancer patients with inoperable MBO were randomized to OCT 0.3 mg/day (OCT group, n = 48) or SB 60 mg/day (SB group, n = 49) for 3 days through a continuous subcutaneous infusion. The following parameters were measured: episodes of vomiting, nausea, dry mouth, drowsiness, and continuous and colicky pain, using a Likert scale corresponding to a numerical value (none 0, slight 1, moderate 2, severe 3) recorded before starting the treatment (T0) and 24 h (T1), 48 h (T2), and 72 h after (T3) and the daily quantity of GI secretions through the Nasogastric tube (NGT) during the period of study. One patient in the SB group is not included in any assessments since she withdrew consent prior to receiving any treatment because of rapidly progressing cancer. RESULTS: OCT significantly reduced the amount of GI secretions at T1, T2, and T3 (P < 0.05) compared with SB. NGT secretions significantly reduced at T1, T2, and T3 compared with T0 (P < 0.05) in the OCT group, while in the SB group, only at T3, NGT secretions significantly reduced compared with T0. OCT treatment induced a significantly rapid reduction in the number of daily episodes of vomiting and intensity of nausea compared with SB treatment. No significant changes were observed in dry mouth, drowsiness, and colicky pain after either drug. Continuous pain values were significantly lower in the OCT group than in the SB group at T2 and T3 (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: At the doses used in this study, OCT was more effective than SB in controlling gastrointestinal symptoms of bowel obstruction. Further studies are necessary to understand the role of hydration more clearly in such a clinical situation.	3a
16029788	Lack of benefit from a short course of androgen deprivation for unfavorable prostate cancer patients treated with an accelerated hypofractionated regime.	PURPOSE: High-dose radiotherapy, delivered in an accelerated hypofractionated course, was utilized to treat prostate cancer. Therapy consisted of external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) and transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)-guided conformally modulated high-dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy. The purpose of this report is (1) to assess long-term comparative outcomes from three trials using similar accelerated hypofractionated regimes; and (2) to examine the long-term survival impact of a short course of < or =6 months adjuvant/concurrent androgen deprivation when a very high radiation dose was delivered. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between 1986 and 2000, 1,260 patients were treated at three institutions with pelvic EBRT (36-50 Gy) integrated with HDR prostate brachytherapy. The total dose including brachytherapy was given over 5 weeks. The biologic equivalent EBRT dose ranged between 90 and 123 Gy (median, 102 Gy) using an alpha /beta of 1.2. Patient eligibility criteria included a pretreatment prostate-specific antigen > or =10, Gleason score > or =7, or clinical stage > or =T2b. A total of 1,260 patients were treated, and 934 meet the criteria. Kiel University Hospital treated 198 patients; William Beaumont Hospital, 315; and California Endocurietherapy Cancer Center, 459 patients. Brachytherapy dose regimes were somewhat different between centers and the dose was escalated from 5.5 x 3 to 15 Gy x 2 Gy. Patients were divided for analysis between the 406 who received up to 6 months of androgen deprivation therapy and the 528 patients who did not. All patients had a minimum follow-up of 18 months (3 times the exposure to androgen deprivation therapy). The American Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology biochemical failure definition was used. RESULTS: Mean age was 69 years. Median follow-up time was 4.4 years (range, 1.5-14.5); 4 years for androgen deprivation therapy patients and 4.9 for radiation alone. There was no difference at 5 and 8 years in overall survival, cause-specific survival, or biochemical control among the three institutions. The corresponding 8-year rates with and without androgen deprivation therapy were biochemical control 85% and 81%; overall survival 83% and 78%; cause-specific survival 89% and 94%; and metastatic rates of 16.6% and 7.3%. A multivariate analysis revealed androgen deprivation therapy did not predict for biochemical failure for either the entire group or the subset of 177 patients harboring all three poor prognostic factors. Moreover, adding androgen deprivation therapy strongly correlated with higher rates of both metastasis (p = 0.09; hazard ratio, 2.08) and cancer-related deaths (p = 0.02, hazard ratio 3.25). These negative results for the most unfavorable group led us to question if androgen deprivation therapy might have a deleterious impact through delay in delivery of the potentially curative radiation or whether there may be a biologic basis by fixing the cycling cells in G0. CONCLUSIONS: Accelerated hypofractionated pelvic EBRT integrated with TRUS-guided conformally modulated HDR administered to 1,260 patients in three institutions was an excellent method of delivering very high radiation dose to the prostate in 5 weeks. Similar high overall, cause-specific, and biochemical no evidence of disease survival rates achieved show that prostate HDR can be successfully delivered in academic and community settings. At 8 years, the addition of a course of < or =6 months of neoadjuvant/concurrent androgen deprivation therapy to a very high radiation dose did not confer a therapeutic advantage but added side effects and cost. Furthermore, for the most unfavorable group, there was a higher rate of distant metastasis and more prostate cancer-related deaths. We question the value of a short course of androgen deprivation therapy when used with high-dose radiation.	2a
21399726	The use of Valeriana officinalis (Valerian) in improving sleep in patients who are undergoing treatment for cancer: a phase III randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study (NCCTG Trial, N01C5).	Sleep disorders are a substantial problem for cancer survivors, with prevalence estimates ranging from 23% to 61%. Although numerous prescription hypnotics are available, few are approved for long-term use or have demonstrated benefit in this circumstance. Hypnotics may have unwanted side effects and are costly, and cancer survivors often wish to avoid prescription drugs. New options with limited side effects are needed. The purpose of this trial was to evaluate the efficacy of a Valerian officinalis supplement for sleep in people with cancer who were undergoing cancer treatment. Participants were randomized to receive 450 mg of valerian-or placebo orally 1 hour before bedtime for 8 weeks. The primary end point was area under the curve (AUC) of the overall Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Secondary outcomes included the Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire, the Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI), and the Profile of Mood States (POMS). Toxicity was evaluated with both self-reported numeric analogue scale questions and the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 3.0. Questionnaires were completed at baseline and at 4 and 8 weeks. A total of 227 patients were randomized into this study between March 19, 2004, and March 9, 2007, with 119 being evaluable for the primary end point. The AUC over the 8 weeks for valerian was 51.4 (SD = 16), while that for placebo was 49.7 (SD = 15), with a P value of 0.6957. A supplemental, exploratory analysis revealed that several fatigue end points, as measured by the BFI and POMS, were significantly better for those taking valerian over placebo. Participants also reported less trouble with sleep and less drowsiness on valerian than placebo. There were no significant differences in toxicities as measured by self-report or the CTCAE except for mild alkaline phosphatase increases, which were slightly more common in the placebo group. This study failed to provide data to support the hypothesis that valerian, 450 mg, at bedtime could improve sleep as measured by the PSQI. However, exploratory analyses revealed improvement in some secondary outcomes, such as fatigue. Further research with valerian exploring physiologic effects in oncology symptom management may be warranted.	2b
18958561	Surgery versus radiochemotherapy for resectable locally invasive pancreatic cancer: final results of a randomized multi-institutional trial.	PURPOSE: Although the outcome of surgery for locally advanced pancreatic cancer remains poor, it is improving, with 5-year survival up to about 10% in Japan. The preliminary results of our multi-institutional randomized controlled trial revealed better survival after surgery than after radiochemotherapy. We report the final results of this study after 5 years of follow-up. METHODS: Patients with preoperative findings of pancreatic cancer invading the pancreatic capsule without involvement of the superior mesenteric or common hepatic arteries, or distant metastasis, were included in this randomized controlled trial, with their consent. If the laparotomy findings were consistent with these criteria, the patient was randomized to a surgery group or a radiochemotherapy group (5-fluorouracil 200 mg/m2/day and 5040 Gy radiotherapy). We compared the mean survival time, 3-and 5-year survival rates, and hazard ratio. RESULTS: The surgery and radiochemotherapy groups comprised 20 and 22 patients, respectively. Patients were followed up for 5 years or longer, or until an event occurred to preclude this. The surgery group had significantly better survival than the radiochemotherapy group (P<0.03). Surgery increased the survival time and 3-year survival rate by an average of 11.8 months and 20%, respectively, and it halved the instantaneous mortality (hazard) rate. CONCLUSION: Locally invasive pancreatic cancer without distant metastases or major arterial invasion is treated most effectively by surgical resection.	1b
21367372	Predictors of positive sentinel lymph node in thin melanoma.	BACKGROUND: The treatment of thin melanoma (Breslow thickness <1.0 mm) may include sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy (SLNB). The validity of SLNB for thin melanoma remains widely debated. The purpose of this study was to elucidate pathologic factors that are predictive of SLN positivity. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of a prospective database revealed 1,199 patients diagnosed with primary cutaneous melanoma. Multiple logistic regression was used to determine an association between pathologic factors and SLN positivity. RESULTS: Thin melanomas were identified in 469 patients (39%). Of these, 147 patients (31%) underwent SLNB. Positive SLNs were found in 16 patients (11%). Multiple logistic regression demonstrated that both ulceration (odds ratio, 5.27; P = .047) and thickness (odds ratio, 46.69; P = .022) were associated with SLN positivity. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with thin melanomas >.75 mm and/or ulceration should be considered for SLNB.	2b
21198521	Risk factors in a cohort of patients with multiple primary melanoma.	BACKGROUND: There are various known familial and environmental risk factors that influence the risk for melanoma. This study sought to define the risk factors for multiple primary melanoma. METHODS: A telephone survey of patients with multiple primary melanomas was conducted from a private practice in south-east Queensland, in order to examine various risk factors in this cohort. RESULTS: Our findings of high rates of family history of melanoma (37%), and of dysplastic naevi (42%) support the influence of genotype in this high-risk group. A family history of multiple primary melanomas, seen in 17% of our patients, is a risk factor not previously reported in similar cohort studies. Sixty-eight per cent of patients had an equal or lesser degree of invasive malignancy in subsequent melanomas. Most multiple primary melanoma patients in this group (86.6%) were conducting self skin examination at least once per month. With regards to sun-protective behaviour, 85% reported regular sunscreen use and 92% reported regular use of sun-protective clothing; however, fewer had done this in childhood. CONCLUSIONS: Enhanced knowledge of the genetic and environmental risk factors for multiple primary melanomas can assist clinicians in assessing risk and planning surveillance of patients.	3b
24693415	Effect of herbal therapy to intensity chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting in cancer patients.	BACKGROUND: Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting are the most important complications for cancer patients as its prevalence has been reported to be about 54-96 percent. ginger has been used for medicinal purposes including nausea and vomiting in traditional Persian, Chinese and Indian pharmacopoeia. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of complimentary ginger among cancer patients experiencing nausea and vomiting. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A randomized cross-over clinical trial was carried out on patients under chemotherapy treatment for at least 2 episodes of chemotherapy and at least 2 episodes of previous experience of nausea and vomiting. Subjects of this study received 2 different complementary regimes with 250mg ginger capsule in regime A and placebo capsule in regime B. subjects of the study were crossed over to receive the other regime during the two cycles of chemotherapy. RESULTS: Findings of the study indicated that subjects receiving ginger showed significant reduction in frequency and intensity of nausea and vomiting compared to placebo receiving subjects. CONCLUSIONS: According to finding of this study, in accordance to most of other researches, ginger is an effective agent to reduce chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. However, there are some researches supporting ginger as a moderate antiemetic agent among cancerous patients under chemotherapy.	2b
20479405	Site and timing of first relapse in stage III melanoma patients: implications for follow-up guidelines.	PURPOSE: Stage III melanoma is associated with a high risk of relapse and mortality. Nevertheless, follow-up guidelines have largely been empirical rather than evidence-based. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Clinical records of stage III patients with no evidence of disease seen at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) between 1992 and 2004, who ultimately relapsed, were reviewed retrospectively to evaluate date of first relapse, time to first relapse, method of first relapse detection, and survival. We also determined overall 5-year relapse-free survival (RFS) of all stage III patients seen at MSKCC during this period. RESULTS: The overall 5-year RFS for stage IIIA, IIIB, and IIIIC patients was 63%, 32%, and 11%, respectively. Among relapsing patients, 340 had adequate follow-up to be evaluable for all parameters. Site of first relapse was local/in-transit (28%), regional nodal (21%), or systemic (51%). First relapses were detected by the patient or family, physician, or by screening radiologic tests in 47%, 21%, and 32% of patients, respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed that better overall survival was associated with younger age and first relapse being local/in-transit or nodal, asymptomatic, or resectable. For each substage, we estimated site-specific risk of first relapse. CONCLUSION: Patients detected almost half of first relapses. Our data suggest that routine physical examinations beyond 3 years for stage IIIA, 2 years for stage IIIB, and 1 year for stage IIIC patients and radiologic imaging beyond 3 years for stages IIIA and IIIB and 2 years for stage IIIC patients would be expected to detect few first systemic relapses.	2b
23292233	The efficacy of selenium in prevention of oral mucositis in patients undergoing hematopoietic SCT: a randomized clinical trial.	Oral mucositis (OM) is a complication of high-dose chemotherapy (HDC) followed by hematopoietic SCT (HSCT) with few effective treatments. Selenium has a cytoprotective role via the glutathione peroxidase (Glu.Px) enzyme and prevents chemotherapy-induced toxicities. We performed a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy of selenium on the prevention of OM in 77 patients with leukemia, undergoing allogeneic HSCT. Thirty-seven patients received oral selenium tablets (200 mcg twice daily) from the starting day of HDC to 14 days after transplantation. OM was evaluated daily for 21 days after transplantation according to World Health Organization oral toxicity scale. The incidence of severe OM (grades 3-4) was significantly lower in the selenium group (10.8% vs 35.1%, P<0.05). We noted that the duration of objective OM (grades 2-4), excluding patient's self-declaration (grade 1), was significantly shorter in the selenium group (3.6+/-1.84 vs 5.3+/-2.2 days, P=0.014). Significant elevations in serum selenium level and plasma Glu.Px activity were observed 7 and 14 days after transplantation compared with baseline in the selenium group. We conclude that selenium can reduce the duration and severity of OM after HDC. Clinicaltrial.org ID: NCT01432873.	2b
16679545	Effect of high-dose sodium selenite therapy on polymorphonuclear leukocyte apoptosis in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma patients.	The present study was undertaken to explore the effect of the administration of high doses of sodium selenite on apoptosis in polymorphonuclear leukocytes in patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Thirty patients with newly diagnosed non-Hodgkin's lymphoma were randomly divided into two groups. Group I was treated with chemotherapy and group II received 0.2 mg/kg/d sodium selenite in addition to chemotherapy. Flow cytometry was used for the monitoring of apoptosis on peripheral blood neutrophils at the time of diagnosis and after treatment in both groups of patients. Sodium selenite administration resulted in a significant reduction in neutrophils apoptosis (82+/-10% vs 32+/-18%, p<0.05) and this was associated with significant reduction in infection rate following chemotherapy (67% vs 20%, p<0.05). Also, significant improvement in cardiac ejection fraction was observed (62+/-4% vs 69+/-5% p<0.05). It is concluded that sodium selenite administration at the dosage chosen acts as a cytoprotective agent, alleviating side effects and immunosuppressive effects of cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents.	2b
19398572	Margin clearance and outcome in resected pancreatic cancer.	PURPOSE: Current adjuvant therapies for pancreatic cancer (PC) are inconsistently used and only modestly effective. Because a high proportion of patients who undergo resection for PC likely harbor occult metastatic disease, any adjuvant trials assessing therapies such as radiotherapy directed at locoregional disease are significantly underpowered. Stratification based on the probability (and volume) of residual locoregional disease could play an important role in the design of future clinical trials assessing adjuvant radiotherapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We assessed the relationships between margin involvement, the proximity to operative resection margins and outcome in a cohort of 365 patients who underwent operative resection for PC. RESULTS: Microscopic involvement of a resection margin by tumor was associated with a poor prognosis. Stratifying the minimum clearance of resection margins by 0.5-mm increments demonstrated that although median survival was no different to clear margins based on these definitions, it was not until the resection margin was clear by more than 1.5 mm that optimal long-term survival was achieved. CONCLUSION: These data demonstrate that a margin clearance of more than 1.5 mm is important for long-term survival in a subgroup of patients. More aggressive therapeutic approaches that target locoregional disease such as radiotherapy may be beneficial in patients with close surgical margins. Stratification of patients for entry onto future clinical trials based on this criterion may identify those patients who benefit from adjuvant radiotherapy.	2b
20823419	Non-Sentinel Node Risk Score (N-SNORE): a scoring system for accurately stratifying risk of non-sentinel node positivity in patients with cutaneous melanoma with positive sentinel lymph nodes.	PURPOSE: Sentinel node (SN) biopsy allows identification of patients with melanoma at risk of further metastatic disease in regional non-sentinel nodes (NSN). We investigated clinicopathologic factors that predict NSN positivity in an attempt to identify patients who may be safely spared completion lymph node dissection (CLND). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Clinicopathologic factors previously shown to be predictive of NSN positivity were analyzed in 409 patients with SN-positive disease (309 of whom underwent CLND) managed at a single melanoma center. A weighted score Non-Sentinel Node Risk Score [N-SNORE] incorporating predictive factors was derived, and the efficacy of N-SNORE at stratifying risk of NSN involvement was studied. RESULTS: Factors independently predictive of NSN positivity included primary tumor regression, proportion of harvested SNs involved by melanoma (%PosSN), sex (trend), and SN tumor burden indices (maximum size of largest deposit [MaxSize], % cross-sectional area of SN occupied by tumor, tumor penetrative depth, intranodal location of tumor) and perinodal lymphatic invasion (PLI). Of SN tumor burden criteria, MaxSize was the strongest predictor. N-SNORE was the sum of scores for five parameters: sex (female = 0, male = 1), regression (absent = 0, present = 2), %PosSN (absent = 0, present = 2), MaxSize (</= 0.5 mm = 0, 0.51 to 2.00 mm = 1, 2.01 to 10.00 mm = 2, > 10.00 mm = 3), and PLI (absent = 0, present = 3). N-SNOREs of 0, 1 to 3, 4 to 5, 6 to 7, and >/= 8 were associated with very low (0%), low (5% to 10%), intermediate (15% to 20%), high (40% to 50%), and very high (70% to 80%) risks of NSN involvement. CONCLUSION: A weighted score (N-SNORE) based on clinicopathologic characteristics accurately stratifies risk of NSN involvement in patients with melanoma. If validated in future studies, N-SNORE will better predict prognosis, aid in management decisions, and stratify patient groups for entry into clinical trials.	2b
30414437	Comparison of serum human epididymis protein 4 and CA125 on endometrial cancer detection: A meta-analysis.	BACKGROUND: Endometrial cancer (EC) is common type of gynecologic malignancy affecting a large number of females around the world. While most early stage cases are well managed with a relatively benign prognosis, the late stage cases have poor survival. Among the many biomarkers identified, serum human epididymis protein 4 (HE4) and CA125 are most promising surrogates for EC detection. METHODS: We performed a meta-analysis to estimate the diagnostic accuracy of HE4 and CA125 and compared their performance. A literature research was performed in Medline, Cochrane Literature Library and CNKI. After filtering, twelve studies evaluating the diagnostic value of serum HE4, alone or in comparison with CA125, were included. The total sample size was 1106 patients and 1480 controls. Pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio (PLR), negative likelihood ratio (NLR) and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) were calculated and summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curves were plotted to assess the diagnostic accuracy. RESULTS: The pooled estimates for HE4 were sensitivity: 0.71 (95%CI 0.56-0.82), specificity: 0.87 (95%CI 0.80-0.92), and area under ROC curve: 0.88 (0.85-0.91), compared to 0.35 (95% CI 0.25-0.46), 0.83 (95% CI 0.71-0.91), and 0.58 (95% CI 0.54-0.63), respectively, of CA125. Subgroup analysis demonstrated a better performance of HE4 in Caucasian population, compared to Chinese population. CONCLUSION: This analysis suggested that when stage and histological type are not specifically considered, serum HE4 is generally a better tool than CA125 in EC diagnosis by its significantly higher sensitivity than CA125.	2a
17199134	Bicalutamide 80 mg combined with a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist (LHRH-A) versus LHRH-A monotherapy in advanced prostate cancer: findings from a phase III randomized, double-blind, multicenter trial in Japanese patients.	To compare combination therapy with bicalutamide 80 mg and a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist (LHRH-A) versus LHRH-A alone in Japanese men with untreated advanced prostate cancer. A total of 205 patients with stage C/D prostate cancer were randomized to either LHRH-A+once-daily oral bicalutamide 80 mg or placebo. Primary study variables have been reported previously. Secondary variables included: time to achieve prostate-specific antigen < or = 4 ng/ml, time-to-treatment failure (TTTF), time-to-disease progression (TTP), overall survival (OS), adverse events and adverse drug reactions. Following combination therapy with bicalutamide 80 mg, there were significant (P<0.001) advantages over LHRH-A alone in terms of TTTF and TTP, but the difference in the interim OS was not statistically significant. First-line combination therapy with bicalutamide 80 mg in Japanese patients with advanced prostate cancer offers significant benefits over LHRH-A alone, with respect to TTTF and TTP. Follow-up for OS continues.	1a
10701599	Using gray-scale and color and power Doppler sonography to detect prostatic cancer.	OBJECTIVE: We performed a prospective study to assess gray-scale and color and power Doppler sonography for the detection of prostatic cancer and to determine the impact of operator experience. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Four radiologists with prior experience using gray-scale and Doppler imaging and four urologists with prior experience limited to gray-scale imaging performed sextant biopsies on 251 patients. Each biopsy site was prospectively scored for gray-scale and Doppler abnormality. RESULTS: Cancer was detected in 211 biopsy sites from 85 patients. Overall agreement between sonographic findings and biopsy results as measured with the kappa statistic was minimally superior to chance (kappa = 0.12 for gray-scale, kappa = 0.11 for color Doppler, kappa < or =0.09 for power Doppler). With respect to gray-scale diagnosis of cancer, the performance of radiologists (kappa = 0.12) and urologists (kappa = 0.13) was similar. With respect to power Doppler, the performance of radiologists (kappa = 0.09) was superior to that of urologists (kappa = -0.03, p<0.002). Among patients with at least one positive biopsy for cancer, foci of increased power Doppler flow detected by a radiologist were 4.7 times more likely to contain cancer than adjacent tissues without flow. CONCLUSION: Gray-scale and Doppler imaging did not reveal prostatic cancer with sufficient accuracy to avoid sextant biopsy. Power Doppler may be useful for targeted biopsies when the number of biopsy passes must be limited. There is benefit from increased operator experience with Doppler imaging, but there is no demonstrable benefit of power Doppler over conventional color Doppler sonography.	2a
23054112	Evidence for a better nodal staging system for melanoma: the clinical relevance of metastatic disease confined to the sentinel lymph nodes.	BACKGROUND: The hypothesis tested in this study was whether patients with stage III metastatic melanoma confined to their sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) had a more favorable prognosis than patients who had SLN and non-SLN (NSLN) metastases. METHODS: Patients were identified who were clinically negative in their regional basins but with lymphatic mapping were found to have positive SLNs (331 patients). All patients subsequently underwent a complete lymph node dissection of the lymphatic basin involved, and the total number of metastatic SLNs and NSLNs were documented. RESULTS: As the regional metastatic disease involves NSLNs, disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) decreases. For patients with a total of 2 nodes positive, those with disease confined to the SLNs had a significant better prognosis (DFS and OS: P < .00001) than those in whom 1 SLN and 1 non-SLN was involved. This difference was apparent for those patients with N2 and N3 disease (2 or more nodes positive in their regional basin). A multivariate regression analysis that included Breslow thickness, ulceration, number of positive nodes, and NSLN positivity showed that NSLN positivity (P = .0019) was the most powerful predictor of DFS and OS. CONCLUSIONS: When metastatic melanoma overwhelms the SLN and involves NSLNs, the biologic behavior changes to portend a worse survival, regardless of the total node count positive. These data make the argument that the current N staging system should be changed to incorporate SLN vs NSLN involvement.	3a
19349948	Oncological results, functional outcomes and health-related quality-of-life in men who received a radical prostatectomy or external beam radiation therapy for localized prostate cancer: a study on long-term patient outcome with risk stratification.	Health-related quality-of-life (HRQOL) after a radical prostatectomy (RP) or external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) has not been studied in conjunction with oncological outcomes in relation to disease risk stratification. Moreover, the long-term outcomes of these treatment approaches have not been studied. We retrospectively analyzed oncological outcomes between consecutive patients receiving RP (n=86) and EBRT (n=76) for localized prostate cancer. HRQOL and functional outcomes could be assessed in 62 RP (79%) and 54 EBRT (79%) patients over a 3-year follow-up period (median: 41 months) using the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-36 (SF-36) and the University of California Los Angeles Prostate Cancer Index (UCLA PCI). The 5-year biochemical progression-free survival did not differ between the RP and EBRT groups for low-risk (74.6% vs. 75.0%, P=0.931) and intermediate-risk (61.3% vs. 71.1%, P=0.691) patients. For high-risk patients, progression-free survival was lower in the RP group (45.1%) than in the EBRT group (79.7%) (P=0.002). The general HRQOL was comparable between the two groups. Regarding functional outcomes, the RP group reported lower scores on urinary function and less urinary bother and sexual bother than the EBRT group (P<0.001, P<0.05 and P<0.001, respectively). With risk stratification, the low- and intermediate-risk patients in the RP group reported poorer urinary function than patients in the EBRT group (P<0.001 for each). The sexual function of the high-risk patients in the EBRT group was better than that of the same risk RP patients (P<0.001). Biochemical recurrence was not associated with the UCLA PCI score in either group. In conclusion, low- to intermediate-risk patients treated with an RP may report relatively decreased urinary function during long-term follow-up. The patient's HRQOL after treatment did not depend on biochemical recurrence.	2b
23975663	A phase II randomized trial of induction chemotherapy versus no induction chemotherapy followed by preoperative chemoradiation in patients with esophageal cancer.	BACKGROUND: The contribution of induction chemotherapy (IC) before preoperative chemoradiation for esophageal cancer (EC) is not known. We hypothesized that IC would increase the rate of pathologic complete response (pathCR). METHODS: Trimodality-eligibile patients were randomized to receive no IC (Arm A) or IC (oxaliplatin/FU; Arm B) before oxaliplatin/FU/radiation. Surgery was attempted approximately 5-6 weeks after chemoradiation. The pathCR rate, post-surgery 30-day mortality, overall survival (OS), and toxic effects were assessed. Bayesian methods and Fisher's exact test were used. RESULTS: One hundred twenty-six patients were randomized dynamically to balance the two arms for histology, baseline stage, gender, race, and age. Fifty-five patients in Arm A and 54 in Arm B underwent surgery. The median actuarial OS for all patients (54 deaths) was 45.62 months [95% confidence interval (CI), 27.63-NA], with median OS 45.62 months (95% CI 25.56-NA) in Arm A and 43.68 months (95% CI 27.63-NA) in Arm B (P = 0.69). The pathCR rate in Arm A was 13% (7 of 55) and 26% (14 of 54) in Arm B (two-sided Fisher's exact test, P = 0.094). Safety was similar in both arms. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that IC produces non-significant increase in the pathCR rate and does not prolong OS. Further development of IC before chemoradiation may not be beneficial.

22261362	Concomitant chemoradiotherapy versus acceleration of radiotherapy with or without concomitant chemotherapy in locally advanced head and neck carcinoma (GORTEC 99-02): an open-label phase 3 randomised trial.	BACKGROUND: Concomitant chemoradiotherapy and accelerated radiotherapy independently improve outcomes for patients with locally advanced head and neck squamous-cell carcinoma (HNSCC). We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of a combination of these approaches. METHODS: In our open-label phase 3 randomised trial, we enrolled patients with locally advanced, stage III and IV (non-metastatic) HNSCC and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-2. We randomly allocated patients centrally with a computer program (with centre, T stage, N stage, and localisation as minimisation factors) in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive conventional chemoradiotherapy (70 Gy in 7 weeks plus three cycles of 4 days' concomitant carboplatin-fluorouracil), accelerated radiotherapy-chemotherapy (70 Gy in 6 weeks plus two cycles of 5 days' concomitant carboplatin-fluorouracil), or very accelerated radiotherapy alone (64.8 Gy [1.8 Gy twice daily] in 3.5 weeks). The primary endpoint, progression-free survival (PFS), was assessed in all enrolled patients. This trial is completed. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00828386. FINDINGS: Between Feb 29, 2000, and May 9, 2007, we randomly allocated 279 patients to receive conventional chemoradiotherapy, 280 to accelerated radiotherapy-chemotherapy, and 281 to very accelerated radiotherapy. Median follow-up was 5.2 years (IQR 4.9-6.2); rates of chemotherapy and radiotherapy compliance were good in all groups. Accelerated radiotherapy-chemotherapy offered no PFS benefit compared with conventional chemoradiotherapy (HR 1.02, 95% CI 0.84-1.23; p=0.88) or very accelerated radiotherapy (0.83, 0.69-1.01; p=0.060); conventional chemoradiotherapy improved PFS compared with very accelerated radiotherapy (0.82, 0.67-0.99; p=0.041). 3-year PFS was 37.6% (95% CI 32.1-43.4) after conventional chemoradiotherapy, 34.1% (28.7-39.8) after accelerated radiotherapy-chemotherapy, and 32.2% (27.0-37.9) after very accelerated radiotherapy. More patients in the very accelerated radiotherapy group had RTOG grade 3-4 acute mucosal toxicity (226 [84%] of 268 patients) compared with accelerated radiotherapy-chemotherapy (205 [76%] of 271 patients) or conventional chemoradiotherapy (180 [69%] of 262; p=0.0001). 158 (60%) of 265 patients in the conventional chemoradiotherapy group, 176 (64%) of 276 patients in the accelerated radiotherapy-chemotherapy group, and 190 (70%) of 272 patients in the very accelerated radiotherapy group were intubated with feeding tubes during treatment (p=0.045). INTERPRETATION: Chemotherapy has a substantial treatment effect given concomitantly with radiotherapy and acceleration of radiotherapy cannot compensate for the absence of chemotherapy. We noted the most favourable outcomes for conventional chemoradiotherapy, suggesting that acceleration of radiotherapy is probably not beneficial in concomitant chemoradiotherapy schedules.

3514555	Extended field (periaortic) irradiation in carcinoma of the prostate--analysis of RTOG 75-06.	From 1976 to 1983 the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group conducted a study of extended field (periaortic) irradiation in carcinoma of the prostate. Eligible patients were those with clinical Stage C tumor with or without evidence of pelvic lymph node involvement and also those with Stage A-2 and B with evidence of pelvic lymph node involvement. The stratification criteria included histological grade, clinical stage, absence or presence of hormonal manipulation, and method of lymph node evaluation (lymphangiogram vs. laparotomy vs. no nodal evaluation). The patients were randomized to either receive pelvic irradiation followed by a boost to the prostate or pelvic and periaortic irradiation followed by a boost to the prostate. The prescribed daily dose was 180-200 rad to a total midplane dose to the regional lymphatics to 4000-4500 rad. The prostatic boost target volume was to receive additional 2000-2500 rad bringing the total dose to that area to a minimum of 6500 rad. A total of 523 analyzable patients have been accessioned to the protocol. Four hundred forty-eight of these are known to have received treatment per protocol. Median follow-up is 4 years and 3 months. The analyzable patients were evaluated for the incidence of distant metastases, NED survival and survival as a function of treatment arm. No statistically significant differences between the treatment arms could be documented. Similarly, no significant difference between treatment arms could be documented within a number of subpopulations such as those characterized by a particular grade, hormonal status, stage, age, acid phosphatase level, etc. The results of the study revealed no apparent benefit of elective periaortic irradiation in patients with detectable disease confined to the pelvis.	1a
27185614	Referral Criteria for Outpatient Palliative Cancer Care: A Systematic Review.	BACKGROUND: Outpatient palliative care clinics facilitate early referral and are associated with improved outcomes in cancer patients. However, appropriate candidates for outpatient palliative care referral and optimal timing remain unclear. We conducted a systematic review of the literature to identify criteria that are considered when an outpatient palliative cancer care referral is initiated. METHODS: We searched Ovid MEDLINE (1948-2013 citations) and Ovid Embase (1947-2015 citations) for articles related to outpatient palliative cancer care. Two researchers independently reviewed each citation for inclusion and extracted the referral criteria. The interrater agreement was high (kappa = 0.96). RESULTS: Of the 186 publications in our initial search, 21 were included in the final sample. We identified 20 unique referral criteria. Among these, 6 were recurrent themes, which included physical symptoms (n = 13 [62%]), cancer trajectory (n = 13 [62%]), prognosis (n = 7 [33%]), performance status (n = 7 [33%]), psychosocial distress (n = 6 [29%]), and end-of-life care planning (n = 5 [24%]). We found significant variations among the articles regarding the definition of advanced cancer and the assessment tools for symptom/distress screening. The Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale (n = 7 [33%]) and the distress thermometer (n = 2 [10%]) were used most often. Furthermore, there was a lack of consensus in the cutoffs in symptom assessment tools and timing for outpatient palliative care referral. CONCLUSION: This systematic review identified 20 criteria including 6 recurrent themes for outpatient cancer palliative care referral. It highlights the significant heterogeneity regarding the timing and process for referral and the need for further research to develop standardized referral criteria. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Outpatient palliative care clinics improve patient outcomes; however, it remains unclear who is appropriate for referral and what is the optimal timing. A better understanding of the referral criteria would help (a) referring clinicians to identify appropriate patients for palliative care interventions, (b) administrators to assess their programs with set benchmarks for quality improvement, (c) researchers to standardize inclusion criteria, and (d) policymakers to develop clinical care pathways and allocate appropriate resources. This systematic review identified 20 criteria including 6 recurrent themes for outpatient palliative cancer care referral. It represents the first step toward developing standardized referral criteria.	3a
15861414	Temozolomide plus thalidomide in patients with brain metastases from melanoma: a phase II study.	BACKGROUND: Temozolomide plus thalidomide is a promising oral combination regimen for the treatment of metastatic melanoma. The current Phase II study examined the efficacy and safety of this combination in chemotherapy-naive patients with brain metastases. METHODS: Patients with histologically confirmed metastatic melanoma and measurable brain metastases received temozolomide (75 mg/m2 per day for 6 weeks with a 2-week break between cycles) plus concomitant thalidomide (200 mg/day escalating to 400 mg/day for patients < 70 years or 100 mg/day escalating to 250 mg/day for patients > or = 70 years). The primary end point was tumor response in the brain assessed every 8 weeks. RESULTS: Twenty-six patients with a median age of 60 years were treated. All patients had progressive brain metastases: 16 were symptomatic and 25 had extensive extracranial metastases. Eight patients had received whole-brain radiotherapy, 4 had received stereotactic radiotherapy, and 8 had received craniotomy with resection of hemorrhagic lesions. Fifteen patients completed > or = 1 cycle (median, 1 cycle; range, 0-4 cycles), and 11 discontinued treatment before completing 1 cycle (7 for intracranial hemorrhage, 2 for pulmonary embolism, 1 for deep vein thrombosis, and 1 for Grade 3 rash). Of 15 patients assessable for response, 3 had a complete or partial response (12% intent to treat) and 7 had minor response or stable disease in the brain. However, 5 of these 10 patients had disease progression at extracranial sites. The median survival period was 5 months for all 26 patients and 6 months for the 15 assessable patients. CONCLUSIONS: Temozolomide plus thalidomide was an active oral regimen for patients with brain metastases from malignant melanoma.	4
15245944	Endorectal MRI for prediction of tumor site, tumor size, and local extension of prostate cancer.	OBJECTIVES: To assess the value of endorectal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for detecting the tumor site, tumor size, and disease extent in patients with localized prostate cancer. METHODS: The MRI findings were compared with the histopathologic findings of radical prostatectomy specimens in 95 patients. RESULTS: The histologic examination revealed 186 cancer foci. Endorectal MRI detected 109 cancer foci. The accuracy, sensitivity, and positive predictive value of endorectal MRI for detecting tumor foci greater than 1.0 cm in diameter was 79.8%, 85.3%, and 92.6%, respectively; the corresponding value for detecting tumor foci smaller than 1.0 cm was 24.2%, 26.2%, and 75.9%, respectively. The maximal tumor diameter on endorectal MRI correlated with that shown by histologic examination for tumors larger than 1.0 cm in diameter. However, it did not correlate significantly with the histologic diameter of tumors smaller than 1.0 cm. The accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of endorectal MRI was 74.7%, 57.1%, 82.1%, 57.1%, and 82.1%, respectively, for the detection of extracapsular extension and was 75.8%, 62.1%, 81.8%, 60.0%, and 83.1%, respectively, for local staging. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present study suggest that endorectal MRI is useful for predicting local extension, as well as tumor site and tumor size, of cancer foci greater than 1.0 cm in diameter.	2a
12579279	External beam radiotherapy in bone metastatic prostate cancer: impact on patients' pain relief and quality of life.	Bone metastases are a severe problem in oncology, since they usually are associated with pain. External beam radiation therapy (EBRT) has been, for many years, an important component of the treatment regimen to relieve pain. We have performed a clinical study to evaluate the relationship of response to EBRT in terms of pain relief and improvement in quality of life (QoL). We were also interested in the incidence of acute toxicity with EBRT. We have prospectively evaluated 75 patients (median age 68 years, range 64-79 years) with bone metastases from prostate cancer treated with EBRT, radiographically documented from June 1999 to September 2000. Additional therapies in these patients included: second-line hormonal therapy (HT) in 20 patients, chemotherapy (CT) in 25 patients, biphosphonates in 45 patients. For all patients a pain and narcotic evaluation was done before entering the study. Assessment of response was carried out by evaluating pain relief. QoL was measured by using the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire. Toxicity analysis was based on the ROTG grading system. Survival was calculated by Kaplan-Meier estimate from the start of EBRT treatment until the last follow-up or death. A total of 61 out of 75 patients (81%) experienced some type of pain relief after treatment. The complete response rate was 23%. No significant difference in the response rates was found between the group treated with EBRT alone versus the groups treated with EBRT + CT or EBRT + HT. We noted a significant improvement in some of the scales of the considered EORTC-QLQC30 questionnaire. As expected all treatment-related complications were either grade 1-2 acute or subacute and transitory in nature. The group treated with EBRT + CT experienced slightly higher toxicity rates. There were no treatment-related fatalities. Forteen patients of 61 (23%) responders was alive at 12 months. Our results confirm the ability of EBRT to relieve bony pain in the majority of the cancer patients treated as measured by prospective analysis of pain scales prior to and after EBRT. Minimal side effects were experienced and QoL improved as shown by the results of the specific questionnaire.	2a
22915652	Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase III cross-over study evaluating the oral neurokinin-1 antagonist aprepitant in combination with a 5HT3 receptor antagonist and dexamethasone in patients with germ cell tumors receiving 5-day cisplatin combination chemotherapy regimens: a hoosier oncology group study.	PURPOSE: Aprepitant, a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist (5HT3-RA), and dexamethasone are standard antiemetic therapy for prevention of single-day, cisplatin-induced nausea and vomiting. We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III cross-over study that compared aprepitant to placebo combined with standard antiemetic prophylaxis (a 5HT3-RA and dexamethasone) in patients receiving 5 days of cisplatin combination chemotherapy for testicular cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients receiving two consecutive identical courses of a 5-day cisplatin-based chemotherapy were randomly assigned to aprepitant 125 mg on day 3 and 80 mg per day on days 4 through 7 or to placebo with the initial course and crossover to the opposite treatment with the second course. The primary objective was complete response (CR). Secondary end points were emetic episodes (acute and delayed), nausea measurement based on a visual analog scale (VAS), and patient-stated preference after the second study cycle. RESULTS: In all, 71 patients were screened for the study and 69 were evaluable. Thirty-five patients were randomly assigned to receive aprepitant and 34 to receive placebo for the first course. Forty-two percent achieved CR with aprepitant compared with 13% with placebo (P < .001). Eleven patients (16.2%) had at least one emetic episode during the aprepitant cycle versus 32 patients (47.1%) with placebo. Thirty-eight patients preferred the aprepitant cycle whereas 11 preferred placebo (P < .001). There was no statistical difference in VAS for nausea, but it was numerically superior with aprepitant. There was no toxicity with aprepitant compared with placebo. CONCLUSION: There was a significant improvement in CR rate with aprepitant combined with a 5HT3-RA and dexamethasone. Patient preference strongly favored the aprepitant cycle.	1b
16481820	Management of T3N1 glottic carcinoma: therapeutic outcomes.	OBJECTIVE: The aim of the current study was to determine the best total laryngectomy (TL) approach to the treatment of T3N1 glottic cancer, to study the impact of early nodal disease on stage III glottic cancers, and to describe the preliminary results in a group of patients recently treated for laryngeal preservation (LP). METHODS: A retrospective study of Tumor Research Project data were performed on previously untreated patients with T3N1 glottic squamous cell carcinoma who were treated with curative intent by TL and neck dissection (ND) with or without adjuvant radiation therapy (TL +/- RT) from April 1, 1955 to October 8, 1999 at Washington University School of Medicine/Barnes Jewish Hospital. A preliminary analysis of a similar group of patients more recently treated for LP (1-1-2000 to 1-1-2005) is reported. RESULTS: Forty-two patients with T3N1 glottic carcinoma were treated with TL and ND (TL/ND-16) and TL with ND and TL (TL/ND/RT-26). The 5 year observed survival (OS) and disease-specific survival (DSS) for TL/ND were similar at 62.5%. The 5 year OS and DSS for TL/ND/RT were 53.8% and 58.3%, respectively. There was no survival difference between the two methods. The overall local-regional control rate was 73.9% (11/42 recurrences). The overall recurrence rate was 38%, with 7.1% recurrence at both the primary site and neck. Recurrence was not related to treatment method. The overall salvage rate (5 year DSS after retreatment) was 20% with 50% salvage for patients with neck recurrence. No patients with local recurrence were survivors. The incidence of second primary cancers was 6.8%. More recently, 26 similar patients were treated with LP techniques. Preliminary results showed a 3 year OS of 63.5% and DSS of 76.8%. Local-regional control was 85.4%. LP was 88.5%. CONCLUSIONS: The two TL modalities had statistically similar results in terms of survival, recurrence, and complications. Decreased DSS was seen in older patients (>65 years) and in patients with involved resection margins, recurrent disease, and distant metastasis. Patients with T3N1 glottic cancer had an 8% decrease in DSS compared to patients with T3N0 disease. Previously patients with T3N1 disease have been treated with TL resulting in loss of natural voice in all patients. Preliminary results on 26 patients with T3N1 disease, treated between 2000 and 2005 with voice preservation intent, indicate that the OS, DSS, and local-regional control rates were similar to the TL group, whereas 88.5% of patients maintained natural voice and natural breathing. Use of LP techniques should be the initial therapeutic approach for patients with T3N1 glottic cancer.	4
16054572	Follow-up in patients with localised primary cutaneous melanoma.	Follow-up services for patients with localised cutaneous melanoma are widely discussed but there is no international consensus. Our aim was to discuss frequency and duration of follow-up, type of health professional involved, optimum intensity of routine investigation, and patients' satisfaction with follow-up. Searches of the published work were directed at publications between January, 1985, and February, 2004 on recurrences, subsequent primary melanoma, routine tests, and patients' satisfaction. In a selection of 72 articles, 2142 (6.6%) recurrences were reported, 62% of which were detected by the patients themselves. 2.6% of patients developed a subsequent primary melanoma. Most investigators do not support high-intensity routine follow-up investigations. Of the various follow-up investigations requested by physicians, only medical history and physical examination seem to be cost effective. Lymph-node sonography seems to be a promising method for detection, although survival benefit remains to be proven. Patients were found to be anxious about follow-up visits, although other research showed that provision of information to patients was much appreciated. Published work on the follow-up of patients with cutaneous melanoma has mainly been retrospective and descriptive. Recommendations can be given with only a low grade of evidence. For meaningful guidelines to be developed, prospective, high-quality methodological research is needed.	2b
11439208	Time-dose-response relationships in postoperatively irradiated patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinomas.	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To define the influence of the dose and time on the response to treatment in postoperatively irradiated head and neck cancer patients and to establish a good prediction of failure. METHODS AND MATERIALS: From January 1985 to December 1995, 214 patients with histologically proven head and neck squamous cell carcinomas were irradiated after radical surgery or single tumour resection according to surgical and histopathological findings. The total doses given ranged between 50 and 75 Gy to the primary bed tumour and between 42 and 56 Gy to the neck with fraction sizes of 1.7-2 Gy/day. The median length of the time interval between surgery and radiotherapy, time of irradiation and total treatment time were 81, 59 and 139 days, respectively. The end-point analyzed was the local-regional tumour control rate at the primary tumour bed and neck for 5 years from the beginning of radiotherapy. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to determine predictors of failure from among the following studied variables: (i), clinical stage (T/N) of the patients; (ii), tumour grade; (iii), neck surgery; (iv), tumour margins; (v), histological tumour nodal extension; (vi), chemotherapy; (vii), normalized total dose; (viii), time interval between surgery and radiotherapy; (ix), time of irradiation; and (x), total treatment time. RESULTS: The actuarial 5-year tumour control rate for the entire group was 72%, and 92% of the patients who achieved local control are currently alive without disease. Tumour control was inversely related to T stage (83% for T2 vs. 57% for T4) and the probability of local control within each stage was dependent on the N status (> or =71% for T3-T4/N0 vs. 31-44% for T3-T4/N1-N3). Histological N status and tumour margins, but not tumour grade, impacted significantly on tumour control. When local control was analyzed as a function of the dose to the primary, a non-significant negative dose-response relationship was found. The total treatment time was a significant prognostic factor, and the time interval between surgery and irradiation proved to be an independent predictor of failure. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the absence of a statistically significant dose-response relationship, the present results suggest that postoperative irradiation treatment given to patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinomas should not be unduly prolonged, in order to minimize the amount of tumour cell proliferation. In these patients, nodal involvement, positive margins of the resected specimens and time interval between surgery and irradiation were the most important prognostic factors.	4
23249111	Global and health-related quality of life after intensity-modulated radiation therapy for head and neck cancer.	This study aims to evaluate the current literature regarding the effects of conventional radiation therapy (CRT) versus intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) on global quality of life (QoL) among patients treated for head and neck cancer. A PubMed literature review was performed. Only articles comparing global QoL scores in head and neck cancer patients treated with CRT versus IMRT were included. Studies were scrutinized for methodology, level of evidence and limitations. Outcomes were evaluated for external validity, level of evidence and applicability. Between 2005 and 2012, 14 eligible studies (six prospective, two randomized controlled trials) were identified. Although all presented data comment on the advantages of IMRT, differences in study design made comparisons difficult. The vast majority of these were also limited by relatively small sample sizes and heterogeneity with respect to patient and treatment-related characteristics. Although more robust evidence is needed in the future, the published data reasonably support the benefits of IMRT as compared with CRT (either 2D or 3D) in improving QoL, beginning at approximately 3-6 months post-treatment, and possibly potentiating with time up to 2 and 3 years.	2b
20227123	Subgroup analysis of patients with localized prostate cancer treated within the Dutch-randomized dose escalation trial.	PURPOSE: To investigate the effect of dose escalation within prognostic risk groups in prostate cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 1997 and 2003, 664 patients with localized prostate cancer were randomly assigned to receive 68- or 78-Gy of radiotherapy. Two prognostic models were examined: a risk group model (low-, intermediate-, and high-risk) and PSA-level groupings. High-risk patients with hormonal therapy (HT) were analyzed separately. Outcome variable was freedom from failure (FFF) (clinical failure or PSA nadir+2 microg/L). RESULTS: In relation to the advantage of high-dose radiotherapy, intermediate-risk patients benefited most from dose escalation. However no significant heterogeneity could be demonstrated between the risk groups. For two types of PSA-level groupings: PSA<10 and > or = 10 microg/L, and <8, 8-18 and >8 microg/L, the test for heterogeneity was significant (p=0.03 and 0.05, respectively). Patients with PSA 8-18 microg/L (n=297, HR=0.59) derived the greatest benefit from dose escalation. No heterogeneity could be demonstrated for high-risk patients with and without HT. CONCLUSION: Intermediate-risk group derived the greatest benefit for dose escalation. However, from this trial no indication was found to exclude low-risk or high-risk patients from high-dose radiotherapy. Patients could be selected for high-dose radiotherapy based on PSA-level groupings: for patients with a PSA<8 microg/L high-dose radiotherapy is probably not indicated, but should be confirmed in other randomized studies.	1b
3054099	Multimodality detection of metastatic melanoma.	A retrospective evaluation of radionuclide liver and spleen scintigraphy (LS), ultrasonography (US), and computed tomography (CT) was performed in 88 patients who had pathologically proven cutaneous melanoma. In patients who had all three examinations (n = 24), the matrix analysis showed that CT was significantly more sensitive (0.94) in detecting intra-abdominal metastasis when compared to US (0.62, P less than 0.05) and LS (0.38, P less than 0.01). Sixty-four patients had only US and LS studies. In this group of patients US was found to be more sensitive than LS, 0.88 and 0.54 respectively (P less than 0.01). Furthermore, when CT was compared with US, CT was shown to detect metastases significantly earlier than US (P = 0.03). Overall, CT provided the most accurate means for detecting the intra-abdominal metastases of cutaneous melanoma.	3b
19047297	Cardiovascular mortality after androgen deprivation therapy for locally advanced prostate cancer: RTOG 85-31.	PURPOSE: Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists are associated with greater risk of coronary heart disease and myocardial infarction in men with prostate cancer, but little is known about potential impact on cardiovascular mortality. We assessed the relationship between GnRH agonists and cardiovascular mortality in a large randomized phase III trial of men treated with or without adjuvant goserelin after radiation therapy (RT) for locally advanced prostate cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 1987 and 1992, 945 men with locally advanced prostate cancer were randomly assigned to RT and adjuvant goserelin or RT alone. Fine and Gray's regression was used to evaluate treatment effect on cardiovascular mortality. Covariates included age, prevalent cardiovascular disease (CVD), hypertension, diabetes mellitus (DM), body mass index, race, Gleason score, stage, acid phosphatase level, prostatectomy history, and nodal involvement. RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 8.1 years, there were 117 cardiovascular-related deaths but no treatment-related increase in cardiovascular mortality. At 9 years, cardiovascular mortality for men receiving adjuvant goserelin was 8.4% v 11.4% for men treated without adjuvant goserelin (Gray's P = .17). In multiple regression analyses, treatment arm was not significantly associated with increased risk of cardiovascular mortality (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] = 0.73; 95% CI, 0.47 to 1.15; P = .16; when censoring at time of salvage goserelin therapy, HR = 0.99; 95% CI, 0.58 to 1.69; P = .97). Traditional cardiac risk factors, including prevalent CVD and DM, were significantly associated with greater cardiovascular mortality. CONCLUSION: GnRH agonists do not seem to increase cardiovascular mortality in men with locally advanced prostate cancer. Further studies are warranted to evaluate adverse effects of GnRH agonists in men with lower cancer-specific mortality.	1a
15737905	103Pd brachytherapy versus radical prostatectomy in patients with clinically localized prostate cancer: a 12-year experience from a single group practice.	PURPOSE: In an effort to shed light on the continuing debate over the best treatment options for patients with localized prostate cancer, we present a retrospective review of patients from a single group community urology practice. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Data from 1707 patients were reviewed. These patients, with T1 or T2 adenocarcinoma of the prostate, were treated from 1992 to 2004 with either brachytherapy or radical retropubic prostatectomy (RRPP); 81% were aged over 65 years. Patients were classified into risk groups based on initial prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and Gleason score. Time to PSA-indicated recurrence was used as the measure of disease control and cure. RESULTS: Time to PSA-indicated recurrence was used as a measure of efficacy. Brachytherapy with 103Pd exclusively and RRPP were found to provide equivalent control (<0.4 ng/mL for prostatectomy and <3 successive rises in PSA as defined by the American Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology [ASTRO]) in low-risk groups (89% seeds vs. 94% RRPP). In intermediate (89% seeds vs. 58% RRPP) and high-risk (88% seeds vs. 43% RRPP) groups, brachytherapy patients had better control rates. The addition of external radiation, with or without luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone therapy, improved biochemical control rates in intermediate and high-risk brachytherapy groups. CONCLUSION: The results failed to show any superiority of prostatectomy over brachytherapy with 103Pd (TheraSeed; Theragenics Corp., Buford, GA) regarding time until relapse as indicated by PSA level increase (>0.4 ng/mL for prostatectomy and >3 successive rises in PSA as defined by ASTRO). We recently reviewed our techniques and improved equipment from 1995 to present and found major gains with both brachytherapy and surgery. Low risk brachytherapy resulted in 99% freedom from PSA failure while surgery showed results of 97%. Brachytherapy and prostatectomy should be offered without bias to all men with stage T1 and T2 organ-confined prostate cancer.	2a
3112864	Malignant melanoma: analysis of dose fractionation in radiation therapy.	Thirty-five patients with 67 measureable cutaneous or lymph node metastases from malignant melanoma were treated with radiation therapy in a variety of total doses and dose fractions. There was no correlation between total dose and response rate. However, there was a strong correlation between fraction size and response rate. There were four (9%) complete responses in 43 lesions treated with fractions less than or equal to 500 rad (5 Gy) compared with 12 (50%) complete responses in 24 lesions treated with fractions greater than 500 rad (5 Gy) (P = .0006). Initial response rate was found to correlate strongly with local control at 1 year. The results were then analyzed with respect to lesion size, cutaneous versus nodal lesions, and site of cutaneous lesion (trunk, head and neck, or extremity). Correlation between fraction size and response rate was independent of lesion size, although there were fewer complete responses with increasing lesion size. Correlation was not seen in nodal lesions but was particularly striking in cutaneous lesions. This correlation was statistically significant only for cutaneous lesions of the extremities.	4
10740600	Transcutaneous fine needle aspiration biopsy of the preepiglottic space.	OBJECTIVE: To evaluate transcutaneous fine needle aspiration biopsy of the preepiglottic space for staging supraglottic squamous cell carcinoma. STUDY DESIGN: We studied 28 patients who underwent total or horizontal supraglottic laryngectomy as their main therapy modality due to supraglottic squamous cell carcinoma, followed in some cases by adjuvant radiation therapy. All the patients underwent transcutaneous fine needle aspiration. RESULTS: The cytopathologic examination of the material obtained by aspiration was compared to the histopathologic analysis of the laryngectomy specimens; the efficiency was 96.4%. The method did not cause any morbidity. CONCLUSION: Transcutaneous fine needle aspiration biopsy of the preepiglottic space is useful for preepiglottic space evaluation, with a high correlation with histopathologic results and no morbidity.	4
16198768	Post-surgery adjuvant therapy with intermediate doses of interferon alfa 2b versus observation in patients with stage IIb/III melanoma (EORTC 18952): randomised controlled trial.	BACKGROUND: Individuals affected by melanoma with thick primary tumours or regional node involvement have a poor outlook, with only 30-50% alive at 5 years. High-dose and low-dose interferon alfa have been assessed for the treatment of these patients, with the former having considerable toxicity and a consistent effect on disease free survival, but not on overall survival, and the latter no consistent effect on either. Our aim was, therefore, to assess the effect of two regimens of interferon of intermediate dose versus observation alone on distant metastasis-free interval (DMFI) and overall survival in such patients. METHODS: We did a randomised controlled trial in 1388 patients who had had a thick primary tumour (thickness > or = 4 mm) resected (stage IIb) or regional lymph node metastases dissected (stage III) and had been assigned to 13-months (n=553) or 25 months (n=556) of treatment with subcutaneous interferon alfa 2b, or observation (n=279). Treatment comprised 4 weeks of 10 million units (MU) of interferon alfa (5 days per week) followed by either 10 MU three times a week for 1 year or 5 MU three times a week for 2 years, to a total dose of 1760 MU. Our primary endpoint was DMFI. Analyses were by intent to treat. FINDINGS: After a median follow-up of 4.65 years, we had recorded 760 distant metastases and 681 deaths. At 4.5 years, the 25-month interferon group showed a 7.2% increase in rate of DMFI (hazard ratio 0.83, 97.5% CI 0.66-1.03) and a 5.4% improvement in overall survival. The 13-month interferon group showed a 3.2% increase in rate of DMFI at 4.5 years (0.93, 0.75-1.16) and no extension of overall survival. Toxicity was acceptable, with 18% (195 of 1076) of patients going off study because of toxicity or as a result of refusal of treatment because of side-effects. INTERPRETATION: Interferon alfa as used in the regimens studied does not improve outcome for patients with stage IIb/III melanomas, and cannot be recommended. With respect to efficacy of the drug, duration of treatment seemed more important than dose, and should be assessed in future trials.	1b
21631324	gp100 peptide vaccine and interleukin-2 in patients with advanced melanoma.	BACKGROUND: Stimulating an immune response against cancer with the use of vaccines remains a challenge. We hypothesized that combining a melanoma vaccine with interleukin-2, an immune activating agent, could improve outcomes. In a previous phase 2 study, patients with metastatic melanoma receiving high-dose interleukin-2 plus the gp100:209-217(210M) peptide vaccine had a higher rate of response than the rate that is expected among patients who are treated with interleukin-2 alone. METHODS: We conducted a randomized, phase 3 trial involving 185 patients at 21 centers. Eligibility criteria included stage IV or locally advanced stage III cutaneous melanoma, expression of HLA*A0201, an absence of brain metastases, and suitability for high-dose interleukin-2 therapy. Patients were randomly assigned to receive interleukin-2 alone (720,000 IU per kilogram of body weight per dose) or gp100:209-217(210M) plus incomplete Freund's adjuvant (Montanide ISA-51) once per cycle, followed by interleukin-2. The primary end point was clinical response. Secondary end points included toxic effects and progression-free survival. RESULTS: The treatment groups were well balanced with respect to baseline characteristics and received a similar amount of interleukin-2 per cycle. The toxic effects were consistent with those expected with interleukin-2 therapy. The vaccine-interleukin-2 group, as compared with the interleukin-2-only group, had a significant improvement in centrally verified overall clinical response (16% vs. 6%, P=0.03), as well as longer progression-free survival (2.2 months; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.7 to 3.9 vs. 1.6 months; 95% CI, 1.5 to 1.8; P=0.008). The median overall survival was also longer in the vaccine-interleukin-2 group than in the interleukin-2-only group (17.8 months; 95% CI, 11.9 to 25.8 vs. 11.1 months; 95% CI, 8.7 to 16.3; P=0.06). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with advanced melanoma, the response rate was higher and progression-free survival longer with vaccine and interleukin-2 than with interleukin-2 alone.

23977264	Pyridoxine for prevention of hand-foot syndrome caused by chemotherapy: a systematic review.	BACKGROUND: Hand-foot syndrome (HFS) is a relatively frequent dermatologic toxic reaction to certain anti-cancer chemotherapies. The syndrome can evolve into a distressing condition that limits function and affects quality of life. Pyridoxine (vitamin B6) has been used empirically for the prevention of HFS caused by anti-cancer therapy. However, evidence of its efficacy remains controversial. METHODOLOGY//PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Systematic literature searches were conducted on the Cochrane Library, PUBMED, EMBASE, LILACS, CBM, CNKI, VIP, WANFANG and the U.S. ClinicalTrials.gov website. We included all related randomized controlled trials (RCTs) irrespective of language. Reviewers from different professions independently assessed all potential studies and extracted data. Subgroup analysis was planned according to dose of pyridoxine. 5 RCTs involving 607 patients were contributed to the meta-analysis. No significant differences were found between patients receiving pyridoxine and placebo for prevention of incidence of HFS and grade 2 or worse HFS (relative risk (RR) 0.96, 95%confidence interval (CI) 0.86-1.06; RR0.95, 95%CI 0.73-1.24, respectively). Similarly, no significant improvement in quality of life was detected among patients. However, significant difference was found for prevention of grade 2 or worse HFS with pyridoxine 400 mg daily compared to 200 mg (RR0.55, 95%CI 0.33-0.92). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: There is inadequate evidence to make any recommendation about using pyridoxine for prevention of HFS caused by chemotherapy. However, pyridoxine 400 mg may have some efficacy. Further studies of large sample sizes are needed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of pyridoxine, especially at high dose, in comparison with placebo.	1a
27126630	Association of Distance Traveled for Surgery with Short- and Long-Term Cancer Outcomes.	BACKGROUND: The influence of distance traveled for treatment on short- and long-term cancer outcomes is unclear. METHODS: Patients with colon, esophageal, liver, and pancreas cancer from 2003 to 2006 were identified from the National Cancer Data Base (NCDB). Distance traveled for surgical treatment was estimated using zip code centroids. Propensity scores were generated for probability of traveling farther for treatment. Mixed effects logistic regression for 90-day mortality and Cox regression for 5-year mortality were compared between patients treated regionally and those traveling from farther away. RESULTS: The mean distance traveled for all patients for surgical resection was 30.0 +/- 227 miles, with a median distance of 7.5 (interquartile range 14.4) miles. Patients who were aged >/=80 years, on Medicaid, or African American were less likely to be in the fourth quartile of distance (Q4) traveled for surgery. Patients who were in Q4 had a lower risk-adjusted 90-day mortality compared to Q1 for colon [odds ratio (OR) 0.89, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.82-0.96], liver (OR 0.49, 95 % CI 0.3-0.78), and pancreatic (OR 0.74, 95 % CI 0.56-0.98) cancer. Similarly, patients in Q4 for all tumor types had a lower risk-adjusted 5-year mortality compared to patients in Q1; colon (hazard ratio (HR) 0.96, 95 % CI 0.93-0.99), esophagus (HR 0.84, 95 % CI 0.75-0.94), liver (HR 0.75, 95 % CI 0.62-0.89), and pancreas (HR 0.87, 95 % CI 0.80-0.95). CONCLUSIONS: Greater travel distance for surgical resection of gastrointestinal cancers is associated with lower 90-day and 5-year mortality outcomes. This distance bias has implications for regionalization and reporting of cancer outcomes.	3b
3334956	Analysis of dose fractionation in the palliation of metastases from malignant melanoma.	Sixty-five visceral metastases from malignant melanoma were treated with radiation therapy. A variety of total doses and dose fractions were used. Significant palliation was achieved in 40 of 65 (62%) symptomatic lesions. There was no correlation between total dose or dose fraction size and significant palliation. Brain and bone metastases were separately analyzed. Nineteen of 28 (68%) bone metastases were palliated. Appendicular bony metastases were more likely to be palliated than axial bony metastases (88% versus 60%). The palliation of bone metastases did not depend on total dose given or fraction size. Nine of 23 (39%) symptomatic brain metastases were palliated. There was no difference in the rate of palliation between solitary and multiple brain metastases. Palliation of brain lesions was not dependent on fraction size, although there was a trend to better palliation with higher total doses. These findings suggest that unlike treating cutaneous or nodal melanoma lesions for local control, there is no advantage in large fraction size when treating with palliative intent visceral melanoma lesions.	4
22694829	Health related quality of life outcomes for unresectable stage III or IV melanoma patients receiving ipilimumab treatment.	"BACKGROUND: In an international, randomized Phase III trial ipilimumab demonstrated a significant overall survival benefit in previously treated advanced melanoma patients. This report summarizes health-related quality of life (HRQL) outcomes for ipilimumab with/without gp100 vaccine compared to gp100 alone during the clinical trial's 12 week treatment induction period. METHODS: The Phase III clinical trial (MDX010-20) was a double-blind, fixed dose study in 676 previously treated advanced unresectable stage III or IV melanoma patients. Patients were randomized 3:1:1 to receive either ipilimumab (3 mg/kg q3w x 4 doses) + gp100 (peptide vaccine; 1 mg q3w x 4 doses; ipilimumab plus gp100, n = 403); gp100 vaccine + placebo (gp100 alone, n = 136); or ipilimumab + placebo (ipilimumab alone, n = 137). The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) assessed HRQL. Baseline to Week 12 changes in EORTC QLQ-C30 function, global health status, and symptom scores were analyzed for ipilimumab with/without gp100 vaccine compared to gp100 alone. Mean change in scores were categorized ""no change"" (0-5), ""a little"" (5-10 points), ""moderate"" (10-20 points), and ""very much"" (>20). RESULTS: In the ipilimumab plus gp100 and ipilimumab alone groups, mean changes from baseline to Week 12 generally indicated ""no change"" or ""a little"" impairment across EORTC QLQ-C30 global health status, function, and symptom subscales. Significant differences in constipation, favoring ipilimumab, were observed (p < 0.05). For ipilimumab alone arm, subscales with no or a little impairment were physical, emotional, cognitive, social function, global health, nausea, pain, dyspnea, constipation, and diarrhea subscales. For the gp100 alone group, the observed changes were moderate to large for global health, role function, fatigue, and for pain. CONCLUSIONS: Ipilimumab with/without gp100 vaccine does not have a significant negative HRQL impact during the treatment induction phase relative to gp100 alone in stage III or IV melanoma patients. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov identification number NCT00094653."	1b
15837996	Efficacy and tolerability of aprepitant for the prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting in patients with breast cancer after moderately emetogenic chemotherapy.	PURPOSE: This is the first study in which the NK(1)-receptor antagonist, aprepitant (APR), was evaluated for the prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) with moderately emetogenic chemotherapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eligible breast cancer patients were naive to emetogenic chemotherapy and treated with cyclophosphamide +/- doxorubicin or epirubicin. Patients were randomly assigned to either an aprepitant regimen (day 1, APR 125 mg, ondansetron (OND) 8 mg, and dexamethasone 12 mg before chemotherapy and OND 8 mg 8 hours later; days 2 through 3, APR 80 qd) [DOSAGE ERROR CORRECTED] or a control regimen (day 1, OND 8 mg and dexamethasone 20 mg before chemotherapy and OND 8 mg 8 hours later; days 2 through 3, OND 8 mg bid). Data on nausea, vomiting, and use of rescue medication were collected with a self-report diary. The primary efficacy end point was the proportion of patients with complete response, defined as no vomiting and no use of rescue therapy, during 120 hours after initiation of chemotherapy in cycle 1. The secondary end point was the proportion of patients with an average item score higher than 6 of 7 on the Functional Living Index-Emesis questionnaire. RESULTS: Of 866 patients randomized, 857 patients (99%) were assessable. Overall complete response was greater with the aprepitant regimen than with the control regimen (50.8% v 42.5%; P = .015). More patients in the aprepitant group reported minimal or no impact of CINV on daily life (63.5% v 55.6%; P = .019). Both treatments were generally well tolerated. CONCLUSION: The aprepitant regimen was more effective than the control regimen for prevention of CINV in patients receiving both an anthracycline and cyclophosphamide.	1a
20067460	Prostate-specific antigen relapse-free survival and side-effects in 734 patients with up to 10 years of follow-up with localized prostate cancer treated by permanent iodine implants.	STUDY TYPE: Therapy (case series) Level of Evidence 4. OBJECTIVE: To report our analysis of the oncological outcome, side-effects and complications after (125)I-brachytherapy, based on 10 years of experience, as low dose-rate (LDR) prostate brachytherapy is an accepted, effective and safe therapy for localized prostate cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between April 1999 and December 2006, 734 consecutive patients were treated with clinically localized prostate cancer with a follow-up of >or=30 months. No patients received external beam radiotherapy and 43% received hormonal therapy before brachytherapy; this therapy was given for 3-4 months. All patients had LDR prostate brachytherapy administered by one radiation oncologist. Biochemical failure was defined according to the 'Phoenix consensus'. RESULTS: The median follow-up for the 734 patients was 55 months; 26 had a clinical relapse and 11 died from prostate cancer; 20 patients died from other illnesses. The 10-year actuarial biochemical control was 92%, 84% and 65%, respectively (P < 0.001) for the low-, intermediate- and high-risk groups. Multivariate Cox regression analyses identified Gleason score and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level as independent prognostic factors for biochemical failure. The actuarial biochemical control with Gleason score was 88%, 76% and 67% for patients with a Gleason score of <or=6, 7 and >7, respectively (P < 0.001). The biochemical control was 90%, 80% and 42% for patients with a PSA level of <or=10, 10.1-20 and >20 ng/mL, respectively (P < 0.001). No patients reported incontinence after treatment. There was acute urinary retention in 22 (2.9%) patients. Logistic regression showed that the most significant factors correlating with the probability of catheterization were the pretreatment prostate volume and hormonal therapy. CONCLUSIONS: The excellent long-term results and low morbidity, and the many advantages of prostate brachytherapy over other treatments, show that brachytherapy is an effective treatment for clinically organ-confined prostate cancer.	3a
26621521	YOCAS(c)(R) Yoga Reduces Self-reported Memory Difficulty in Cancer Survivors in a Nationwide Randomized Clinical Trial: Investigating Relationships Between Memory and Sleep.	UNLABELLED: Background Interventions are needed to alleviate memory difficulty in cancer survivors. We previously showed in a phase III randomized clinical trial that YOCAS(c)(R) yoga-a program that consists of breathing exercises, postures, and meditation-significantly improved sleep quality in cancer survivors. This study assessed the effects of YOCAS(c)(R) on memory and identified relationships between memory and sleep. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Survivors were randomized to standard care (SC) or SC with YOCAS(c)(R) . 328 participants who provided data on the memory difficulty item of the MD Anderson Symptom Inventory are included. Sleep quality was measured using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. General linear modeling (GLM) determined the group effect of YOCAS(c)(R) on memory difficulty compared with SC. GLM also determined moderation of baseline memory difficulty on postintervention sleep and vice versa. Path modeling assessed the mediating effects of changes in memory difficulty on YOCAS(c)(R) changes in sleep and vice versa. RESULTS: YOCAS(c)(R) significantly reduced memory difficulty at postintervention compared with SC (mean change: yoga=-0.60; SC=-0.16; P<.05). Baseline memory difficulty did not moderate the effects of postintervention sleep quality in YOCAS(c)(R) compared with SC. Baseline sleep quality did moderate the effects of postintervention memory difficulty in YOCAS(c)(R) compared with SC (P<.05). Changes in sleep quality was a significant mediator of reduced memory difficulty in YOCAS(c)(R) compared with SC (P<.05); however, changes in memory difficulty did not significantly mediate improved sleep quality in YOCAS(c)(R) compared with SC. CONCLUSIONS: In this large nationwide trial, YOCAS(c)(R) yoga significantly reduced patient-reported memory difficulty in cancer survivors.	1b
21639808	Improved survival with vemurafenib in melanoma with BRAF V600E mutation.	BACKGROUND: Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials of the BRAF kinase inhibitor vemurafenib (PLX4032) have shown response rates of more than 50% in patients with metastatic melanoma with the BRAF V600E mutation. METHODS: We conducted a phase 3 randomized clinical trial comparing vemurafenib with dacarbazine in 675 patients with previously untreated, metastatic melanoma with the BRAF V600E mutation. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either vemurafenib (960 mg orally twice daily) or dacarbazine (1000 mg per square meter of body-surface area intravenously every 3 weeks). Coprimary end points were rates of overall and progression-free survival. Secondary end points included the response rate, response duration, and safety. A final analysis was planned after 196 deaths and an interim analysis after 98 deaths. RESULTS: At 6 months, overall survival was 84% (95% confidence interval [CI], 78 to 89) in the vemurafenib group and 64% (95% CI, 56 to 73) in the dacarbazine group. In the interim analysis for overall survival and final analysis for progression-free survival, vemurafenib was associated with a relative reduction of 63% in the risk of death and of 74% in the risk of either death or disease progression, as compared with dacarbazine (P<0.001 for both comparisons). After review of the interim analysis by an independent data and safety monitoring board, crossover from dacarbazine to vemurafenib was recommended. Response rates were 48% for vemurafenib and 5% for dacarbazine. Common adverse events associated with vemurafenib were arthralgia, rash, fatigue, alopecia, keratoacanthoma or squamous-cell carcinoma, photosensitivity, nausea, and diarrhea; 38% of patients required dose modification because of toxic effects. CONCLUSIONS: Vemurafenib produced improved rates of overall and progression-free survival in patients with previously untreated melanoma with the BRAF V600E mutation.

21700361	Hazard rates for recurrent and secondary cutaneous melanoma: an analysis of 33,384 patients in the German Central Malignant Melanoma Registry.	BACKGROUND: Knowledge about the risk for recurrence and secondary cutaneous melanoma (CM) is an important basis for patient counseling and planning of follow-up examinations. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to analyze stage- and time-dependent hazard rates (HR) and discusses current surveillance recommendations. METHODS: Follow-up data of 33,384 patients with incident CM in stages I to III (American Joint Committee on Cancer 2002) were recorded by the German Central Malignant Melanoma Registry in 1976 through 2007. Survival was based on Kaplan-Meier estimates and HRs were calculated. RESULTS: Recurrences were recorded in 4999 patients (stage I, 7.1%; stage II, 32.8%; and stage III, 51.0%). Ten-year recurrence-free survival was 78.9% (95% confidence interval 73.1-90.5); in stage I, 89.0%; stage II, 56.9%; and stage III, 36.0%. Whereas HR for recurrent CM showed a constantly low level less than or equal to 1:125 per year for stage IA, clearly higher HRs of greater than or equal to 1:40 were recorded in stage IB for the first 3 years and generally in stages II to III. Of all patients 2.3% developed secondary melanomas, with a consistently low HR of less than 1:220 per year. LIMITATIONS: As German recommendations discontinued regular follow-up examinations after 10 years, no information can be given beyond this time point. Follow-up data of longer than 5 years were available in 41.4% of patients. CONCLUSION: For patients at stage IA with thin melanoma and low HR for recurrent CM the need for surveillance remains questionable. For patients with higher HR greater than 1:40 per year, intensified surveillance strategies should be taken into account.	1b
18789638	Efficacy of granisetron in the antiemetic control of nonsurgical intestinal obstruction in advanced cancer: a phase II clinical trial.	The objective of this study was to assess antiemetic efficacy of granisetron in inoperable intestinal obstruction caused by advanced cancer. The study was open, prospective, and multi-centered. We assessed 24 patients (mean age: 61.3 years; 10 males, 14 females) with intestinal obstruction who were refractory to previous antiemetics. Obstruction involved the upper intestine in six patients, the lower intestine in three, and was at multiple levels in 15. Daily treatment included intravenous granisetron (3mg) and dexamethasone (8 mg); nasogastric drainage was not allowed. Subcutaneous haloperidol was available as rescue therapy. A numeric scale was used to evaluate nausea, pain, asthenia, and anorexia at baseline visit and every 24 hours up to the completion of four days of treatment (final visit). Treatment failure was defined as nausea >4 on the numeric scale, vomiting 2/day or more, and rescue therapy with haloperidol at 5mg/day or more. Of the 24 patients, 23 were evaluable for efficacy. Evaluation pre- vs. post-treatment indicated a significant decrease in the severity of nausea (score 6.9 vs. 0.8; P<0.001), number of episodes of vomiting (5.3 vs. 1.0; P<0.001), and abdominal pain (score 4.4 vs. 1.2; P<0.001). Nausea and vomiting control was achieved in 86.9% of patients. Although there was a trend toward greater efficacy in the lower and multiple levels of obstruction, the differences were not statistically significant owing, probably, to small sample size. We conclude that granisetron may be highly efficacious in the control of emesis resulting from intestinal obstruction caused by metastatic cancer, and can be used effectively in patients refractory to other antiemetics.	3a
27285122	Timing and type of immune checkpoint therapy affect the early radiographic response of melanoma brain metastases to stereotactic radiosurgery.	BACKGROUND: Growing evidence suggests that immunotherapy and radiation therapy can be synergistic in the treatment of cancer. This study was performed to determine the effect of the relative timing and type of immune checkpoint therapy on the response of melanoma brain metastases (BrMets) to treatment with stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). METHODS: Seventy-five melanoma patients with 566 BrMets were treated with both SRS and immune checkpoint therapy between 2007 and 2015 at a single institution. Immunotherapy and radiosurgery treatment of any single lesion were considered concurrent if SRS was administered within 4 weeks of immunotherapy. The impact of the timing and type of immunotherapy on the lesional response was determined with the Wilcoxon rank-sum test, which was used to compare the median percent lesion volume change 1.5, 3, and 6 months after SRS treatment, with significance determined by P = .0167 according to the Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. RESULTS: Concurrent use of immunotherapy and SRS resulted in a significantly greater median percent reduction in the lesion volume at 1.5 (-63.1% vs -43.2%, P < .0001), 3 (-83.0% vs -52.8%, P < .0001), and 6 months (-94.9% vs -66.2%, P < .0001) in comparison with nonconcurrent therapy. The median percent reduction in the lesion volume was also significantly greater for anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (anti-PD-1) than anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (anti-CTLA-4) at 1.5 (-71.1% vs -48.2%, P < .0001), 3 (-89.3% vs -66.2%, P < .0001), and 6 months (-95.1% vs -75.9%, P = .0004). CONCLUSIONS: The administration of immunotherapy within 4 weeks of SRS results in an improved lesional response of melanoma BrMets in comparison with treatment separated by longer than 4 weeks. Anti-PD-1 therapy also results in a greater lesional response than anti-CTLA-4 after SRS. Cancer 2016;122:3051-3058. (c) 2016 American Cancer Society.	3a
20066719	Early (sentinel lymph node biopsy-guided) versus delayed lymphadenectomy in melanoma patients with lymph node metastases : personal experience and literature meta-analysis.	BACKGROUND: It is debated whether patients with melanoma who undergo lymphadenectomy after a positive sentinel lymph node (SN) biopsy (SNB) have a better prognosis compared with patients who are treated for clinically evident disease. METHODS: The records of 190 patients with cutaneous melanoma who underwent radical lymph node dissection after a positive SNB (completion lymph node dissection [CLND]; n = 100) or who had clinically evident lymph node metastasis (therapeutic lymph node dissection [TLND]; n = 90) were analyzed. Moreover, the MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases were searched for studies that investigated the survival impact of SNB-guided CLND compared with TLND for clinically evident disease. Standard meta-analysis methods were used to calculate the overall treatment effect across eligible studies. RESULTS: In the authors' series, tumor characteristics did not differ significantly between patients who underwent CLND and those who underwent TLND. After a median follow-up of 52.6 months, the 5-year overall survival rate did not differ significantly between CLND patients and TLND patients (68.9% vs 50.4%, respectively; log-rank test; P = .17). In contrast, a meta-analysis of 6 studies (n = 2633) that addressed this issue (including the authors' own series) indicated that there was a significantly higher risk of death for patients who underwent TLND compared with that for patients who underwent CLND (hazard ratio, 1.60; 95% confidence interval, 1.28-2.00; P < .0001). CONCLUSIONS: Although no significant survival difference was observed in either series, the pooling of summary data from all the studies that dealt with this issue suggested that SNB-guided CLND is associated with a significantly better outcome compared with TLND for clinically evident lymph node disease.	3b
2237726	The justification for surgical treatment of metastatic melanoma of the gastrointestinal tract.	Fifty-six patients with symptomatic metastatic melanoma of the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) treated surgically at the Sydney Melanoma Unit between 1974 and 1989 were reviewed. The majority of these patients presented with abdominal pain or symptoms of anemia. The small intestine was the site of metastasis in more than 80 per cent. The mean over-all survival time was 11.7 months (range of one to 60 months) after surgical treatment of a first metastasis to the GIT and 3.6 months (range of zero to 12 months) postoperatively for a second GIT metastasis. Forty-four of the patients reported complete relief of their symptoms postoperatively. The results suggest that an aggressive approach to symptomatic GIT metastases from malignant melanoma is justified both to relieve distressing symptoms and to prolong life.	3b
18838853	A meta-analysis of the accuracy of prostate cancer studies which use magnetic resonance spectroscopy as a diagnostic tool.	OBJECTIVE: We aimed to do a meta-analysis of the existing literature to assess the accuracy of prostate cancer studies which use magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) as a diagnostic tool. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Prospectively, independent, blind studies were selected from the Cochrane library, Pubmed, and other network databases. The criteria for inclusion and exclusion in this study referenced the criteria of diagnostic research published by the Cochrane center. The statistical analysis was adopted by using Meta-Test version 6.0. Using the homogeneity test, a statistical effect model was chosen to calculate different pooled weighted values of sensitivity, specificity, and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). The summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curves method was used to assess the results. RESULTS: We chose two cut-off values (0.75 and 0.86) as the diagnostic criteria for discriminating between benign and malignant. In the first diagnostic criterion, the pooled weighted sensitivity, specificity, and corresponding 95% CI (expressed as area under curve [AUC]) were 0.82 (0.73, 0.89), 0.68 (0.58, 0.76), and 83.4% (74.97, 91.83). In the second criterion, the pooled weighted sensitivity, specificity, and corresponding 95% CI were 0.64 (0.55, 0.72), 0.86 (0.79, 0.91) and 82.7% (68.73, 96.68). CONCLUSION: As a new method in the diagnostic of prostate cancer, MRS has a better applied value compared to other common modalities. Ultimately, large scale RCT (randomized controlled trial) randomized controlled trial studies are necessary to assess its clinical value.	2b
2258635	Long-term adjuvant therapy of high-risk malignant melanoma with interferon alpha 2b.	Fifty-three high-risk melanoma patients in stage I and 15 patients in stage II were treated after standard surgical intervention with adjuvant therapy with recombinant interferon alpha-2b (rIFN alpha 2b) therapy for a total period of 20 months. Concomitant patients (stage I, n = 82; stage II, n = 33) with identical stages and prognostic factors without adjuvant therapy were used to evaluate the efficacy of rIFN alpha 2b therapy. No difference in 5-year relapse incidence and overall survival rates could be detected. However, it appears that patients of both stage I and stage II benefit from long-term adjuvant rIFN alpha 2b therapy, because during the treatment period (20 months), the incidence of relapses was lower in comparison to controls. After stopping treatment the incidence of relapse is equal in treated and control groups. According to the results of our study, we suggest using continuous low-dose rIFN alpha 2b therapy for adjuvant treatment of malignant melanoma.	2b
17461372	Does social support from family and friends work as a buffer against reactions to stressful life events such as terminal cancer?	OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationship between social support and emotional functioning and stress reactions. Our hypothesis is that patients who reported a high degree of social support will experience better emotional functioning and less serious stress reactions than patients with a low degree of social support. METHOD: The sample was comprised of 434 patients at the Palliative Medicine Unit (PMU), University Hospital of Trondheim in Norway. The patients completed a questionnaire monthly including questions about social support from the MacAdam's Scale, subjective stress measured by the Impact of Event Scale (IES), and emotional functioning measured by the subscale in the EORTC QLQ-30. RESULTS: Although our hypothesis was not supported at the baseline assessment, it was supported at the second assessment, 2 months later. Patients with high social support reported better emotional functioning and less serious stress reactions, in terms of lower scores on the IES avoidance subscale, than patients with a low degree of social support. SIGNIFICANCE OF THE RESULTS: The mixed findings may indicate that social support has only small effects on emotional functioning and stress reactions. Our results on the second assessment indicate, however, that social support might work as a buffer against reactions toward external stressful events such as terminal cancer.	2a
19297565	Mortality results from a randomized prostate-cancer screening trial.	BACKGROUND: The effect of screening with prostate-specific-antigen (PSA) testing and digital rectal examination on the rate of death from prostate cancer is unknown. This is the first report from the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial on prostate-cancer mortality. METHODS: From 1993 through 2001, we randomly assigned 76,693 men at 10 U.S. study centers to receive either annual screening (38,343 subjects) or usual care as the control (38,350 subjects). Men in the screening group were offered annual PSA testing for 6 years and digital rectal examination for 4 years. The subjects and health care providers received the results and decided on the type of follow-up evaluation. Usual care sometimes included screening, as some organizations have recommended. The numbers of all cancers and deaths and causes of death were ascertained. RESULTS: In the screening group, rates of compliance were 85% for PSA testing and 86% for digital rectal examination. Rates of screening in the control group increased from 40% in the first year to 52% in the sixth year for PSA testing and ranged from 41 to 46% for digital rectal examination. After 7 years of follow-up, the incidence of prostate cancer per 10,000 person-years was 116 (2820 cancers) in the screening group and 95 (2322 cancers) in the control group (rate ratio, 1.22; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.16 to 1.29). The incidence of death per 10,000 person-years was 2.0 (50 deaths) in the screening group and 1.7 (44 deaths) in the control group (rate ratio, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.75 to 1.70). The data at 10 years were 67% complete and consistent with these overall findings. CONCLUSIONS: After 7 to 10 years of follow-up, the rate of death from prostate cancer was very low and did not differ significantly between the two study groups.

19184226	The yield of SPECT/CT for anatomical lymphatic mapping in patients with melanoma.	BACKGROUND: The hybrid single-photon emission computed tomography camera with integrated CT (SPECT/CT) fuses tomographic lymphoscintigrams with anatomical CT data. SPECT/CT shows the exact anatomical location of a sentinel node and may detect additional drainage. The purpose of this study was to explore its potential in patients with melanoma. METHODS: We studied 85 patients with melanoma with conventional lymphoscintigrams that were difficult to interpret (51 patients), that showed an unusual drainage pattern (33 patients), or with nonvisualization (1 patient). Forty-one patients had melanoma on an extremity, 31 on the trunk, and 14 in the head and neck region. SPECT/CT was performed following late conventional imaging without reinjection of the radiopharmaceutical. RESULTS: Conventional imaging suggested 214 sentinel nodes in 84 of the 85 patients (99%). SPECT/CT showed these same nodes and 12 extra sentinel nodes in seven patients (8%). Ten of these additional nodes were harvested, of which three nodes of two patients harbored metastases. There was a clear advantage of SPECT/CT in 30 patients (35%), resulting in a different incision in 17 patients, an incision at another site in 8, and an extra incision in 5 patients. The value was questionable in 19 patients (22%) in whom sentinel nodes were more clearly visualized by SPECT/CT, although the incision remained unchanged. There was no additional value of SPECT/CT in 36 patients (42%). CONCLUSIONS: SPECT/CT detects additional drainage and shows the exact anatomical location of sentinel nodes in patients with inconclusive conventional lymphoscintigrams. SPECT/CT facilitates surgical exploration in difficult cases and may improve staging.	2b
19590619	Impact of margin status on survival following pancreatoduodenectomy for cancer: the Leeds Pathology Protocol (LEEPP).	BACKGROUND: In a previous study we reported an 85% R1 rate for pancreatic cancer following the use of the rigorous, fully standardized Leeds Pathology Protocol (LEEPP). As this significantly exceeded R1 rates observed by others, we investigated the reproducibility of margin assessment using the LEEPP in a larger, prospective, observational cohort study and correlated clinicopathological data with survival. METHODS: Clinicopathological features, including exact site and multifocality of margin involvement, and survival were collated from a prospective series of 83 pancreatoduodenectomies for pancreatic (n = 27), ampullary (n = 24) and bile duct cancer (n = 32). Data were compared with those of the previous study in which the same pathology protocol, based on axial slicing and extensive tissue sampling from the circumferential margin, had been used. RESULTS: The R1 rate was high in pancreatic (82%) and bile duct (72%) cancer and significantly lower in ampullary cancer (25%). Margin positivity was often multifocal, the posterior margin being most frequently involved. Margin status correlated with survival in the entire cohort (P = 0.006) and the pancreatic subgroup (P = 0.046). These findings were consistent with observations in our previous study. CONCLUSIONS: Margin involvement in pancreatic cancer is a frequent and prognostically significant finding when specimens are assessed using the LEEPP.	4
17309982	Transoral laser surgery for pharyngeal and pharyngolaryngeal carcinomas.	OBJECTIVE: To assess early oncological and functional outcomes after transoral laser surgery in patients with pharyngeal or pharyngolaryngeal squamous cell carcinoma. DESIGN: Inception cohort, with a median follow-up of 24 months. SETTING: Tertiary university center. PATIENTS: Fifty-five consecutive patients with pharyngeal or pharyngolaryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (T1, 24 patients; T2, 28 patients; and T3, 3 patients) were included. Patients had to be eligible for open functional surgery, and exposure in suspension micropharyngoscopy had to be possible. INTERVENTIONS: The pharynx and larynx were exposed with a bivalved laryngopharyngoscope, and the resection of the tumor was performed with a carbon dioxide laser coupled to a microscope. Neck dissection was performed in 43 patients. It was not attempted in the other 12 patients for the following reasons: N0 neck and severe comorbidities (n = 6), microinvasive cancer (n = 3), patient's refusal (n = 1), inoperable N3 disease (n = 1), and rapid local recurrence (n = 1). Eighteen patients (33%) received adjuvant radiotherapy: 12 for neck disease and 6 for positive resection margins. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Local control and overall survival at the median follow-up visit. Evaluation of complications, pain, and rehabilitation of swallowing capacity. RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 24 months, the local control rate was 90%, and the overall survival rate was 78%. There were 16 early postoperative complications: recurrent aspiration pneumonia (n = 7); laryngeal obstruction, which required tracheotomy (n = 3); severe postoperative hemorrhage (n = 2); and cervical emphysema, which resolved spontaneously (n = 4). Feeding tubes were necessary in 37 patients. They were removed after a median period of 7 days. The median pain score was 4 of 10 during the first postoperative week and 0 of 10 after 4 weeks. The median hospital stay was 13 days (15 days for patients with neck dissection). CONCLUSIONS: Transoral laser surgery for pharyngeal and pharyngolaryngeal squamous cell carcinoma is a safe and acceptable therapeutic modality in selected cases. Good local control and avoidance of tracheotomy can be expected in most cases. Oral food intake is immediate, but feeding tubes are required to avoid weight loss during the postoperative period. Frequent early problems include transient postoperative bronchoinhalations and pain.	4
17985961	Efficacy, safety, and cost effectiveness of intravenous midazolam and flunitrazepam for primary insomnia in terminally ill patients with cancer: a retrospective multicenter audit study.	BACKGROUND: Although intravenous midazolam and flunitrazepam are frequently administered for primary insomnia in Japan, there is no empirical study on their efficacy and safety. DESIGN AND SUBJECTS: To compare the efficacy, safety, and cost-effectiveness of midazolam and flunitrazepam, a multicenter retrospective audit study was performed on 104 and 59 patients receiving midazolam and flunitrazepam, respectively, from 18 certified palliative care units. RESULTS: Median administration periods were 6 days and 9 days for midazolam and flunitrazepam, respectively. The median initial and maximum doses were 10 mg per night and 18 mg per night for midazolam, and 2 mg per night and 2 mg per night for flunitrazepam, respectively. There were no significant differences in the efficacy (91% in the midazolam group versus 81% in the flunitrazepam group, p = 0.084), hangover effect (34% versus 19%, p = 0.094), delirium at night (12% versus 10%, p = 1.0) and delirium next morning (11% versus 15%, p = 0.33), treatment withdrawal (4.8% versus 1.7%, p = 0.41), and treatment-related death (0% versus 0%, p = 1.0). Flunitrazepam caused respiratory depression defined as physician or nurses records such as apnea, respiratory arrest, decreased respiratory rate, and respiratory depression significantly more frequently than midazolam (17% versus 3.8%, p = 0.0073). The maximum dose was more highly correlated with the administration period in the midazolam group than in the flunitrazepam group (rho = 0.52, versus rho = 0.39), and, for patients treated for 14 days or longer, the daily escalation dose ratio required for maintaining adequate sleep was significantly higher in the midazolam group than in the flunitrazepam group (11% versus 2.6%, p = 0.015). The costs of the initial and maximum administration were significantly higher in the midazolam group than in the flunitrazepam group (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Intravenous midazolam and flunitrazepam appeared to be almost equal about efficacy and safety for primary insomnia, but flunitrazepam is less expensive and shows lower risk of tolerance development. A future prospective comparison study is necessary.	2b
11583464	Cartilage invasion of laryngeal cancer detected by magnetic resonance imaging.	Cartilage invasion of laryngeal cancer has a significant impact on the choice of treatment modality and on the outcome for the patients. Cartilage invasion was evaluated radiologically and histopathologically in 18 patients who underwent total laryngectomy. The histopathological examination showed intracartilaginous tumor spread in nine specimens, whereas in the other nine no cartilage invasion was found. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) detected the cartilage invasion in six patients and excluded it in six. There were three false negative and three false positive findings from the MRI examination. The relatively common false findings of MRI should be kept in mind in the choice of treatment.	4
19756681	Outcome of conservation surgery for laryngeal carcinoma: an 8-year trial.	The purpose of this report is to review the experience of our institution with conservative surgery for laryngeal cancer. In this retrospective study, a review was made of 85 patients treated with conservation surgery between 1998 and 2005. At least 2 years of follow-up period (mean 46.6 months) was achieved for all the patients. We evaluated age, tobacco and alcohol intake, T stage, histopathological differentiation and localization of tumor, subglottic extension, anterior commissure invasion, vocal cord mobility, surgical margins, type of surgery applied, and post-operative radiotherapy (pRT) applied. Local control and 2-year survival rates were estimated. We managed with horizontal, vertical, and horizontovertical laryngectomies in 55, 26, and 4 patients, respectively. 28 patients were scheduled to have pRT. The actuarial and overall local control rates were 82.4 and 94.1%, respectively. On univariable analysis, significant factors for increased recurrences were positive resection margins, low differentiation of tumor, alcohol consumption and incompletion of the planned pRT. The 2-year survival rate was 60 and 95.7% for patients with and without local recurrence, respectively. Conservation surgery is a safe procedure for laryngeal cancer in proper endications.	4
23462208	Ipilimumab in melanoma with limited brain metastases treated with stereotactic radiosurgery.	The anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) monoclonal antibody ipilimumab has been shown to improve survival in patients with metastatic non-CNS melanoma. The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy of CTLA-4 inhibitors in the treatment of metastatic melanoma with limited brain metastases treated with stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). Between January 2008 and June 2011, 58 patients with limited brain metastases from melanoma were treated with SRS with a median dose of 20 Gy delivered to the 50% isodose line (range, 15-20 Gy). In 25 patients, ipilimumab was administered intravenously at a dose of 3 mg/kg over 90 min every 3 weeks for a median of four doses (range, 1-8). Local control (LC), freedom from new brain metastases, and overall survival (OS) were assessed from the date of the SRS procedure. The median LC, freedom from new brain metastases, and OS for the entire group were 8.7, 4.3, and 5.9 months, respectively. The cause of death was CNS progression in all but eight patients. Six-month LC, freedom from new brain metastases, and OS were 65, 35, and 56%, respectively, for those who received ipilimumab and 63, 47, and 46% for those who did not (P=NS). Intracranial hemorrhage was noted in seven patients who received ipilimumab compared with 10 patients who received SRS alone (P=NS). In this retrospective study, administration of ipilimumab neither increased toxicity nor improved intracerebral disease control in patients with limited brain metastases who received SRS.	4
17223875	Phase I/II study of topical imiquimod and intralesional interleukin-2 in the treatment of accessible metastases in malignant melanoma.	BACKGROUND: Patients with metastatic skin disease in malignant melanoma can be difficult to treat effectively, often requiring repeated treatments with different modalities in an attempt to control their disease. Treatment of nonsurgically resectable melanoma deposits is unsatisfactory, as they are often multiple and recurring. Anecdotal evidence from individual use of imiquimod in superficial metastases and intralesional interleukin (IL)-2 in subcutaneous deposits suggests that the combination may be more effective in bulky subcutaneous disease. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the combination of topical imiquimod and, for selected lesions, intralesional IL-2, to treat a small cohort of patients with accessible melanoma metastases resistant to other treatments. METHODS: Thirteen patients were recruited: all had evidence of multiple cutaneous and/or subcutaneous metastases. Imiquimod was applied to the metastases on a daily basis for 4 weeks, before the introduction of intralesional IL-2. This was injected up to three times a week, into selected lesions, with 0.1 mL injected per lesion at a concentration of 3.6 MIU mL(-1), a total of 1 mL being given at each session. The treated lesions were assessed individually at intervals of 3 months. RESULTS: Thirteen patients were treated, with 10 being eligible for assessment. In total, 182 lesions were treated: 137 purely cutaneous lesions and 41 subcutaneous lesions. Overall, a clinical response was seen in 92 lesions (50.5%) with 74 (40.7%) of these being a complete response (CR) with 91% of the CRs being in the cutaneous lesions. New lesions did appear during the treatment course; however, patients with cutaneous disease experienced a marked slowing of the appearance of new cutaneous lesions. No cutaneous lesions that responded reappeared on cessation of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of imiquimod and IL-2 is effective in controlling this mixed cutaneous and subcutaneous disease, and is well tolerated. Imiquimod alone is often enough to elicit a response in purely cutaneous lesions. The addition of intralesional IL-2 increases the response rates in subcutaneous lesions, and in otherwise refractory cutaneous lesions.	4
23137997	Assessment of a new scoring system for predicting non-sentinel node positivity in sentinel node-positive melanoma patients.	BACKGROUND: When completion lymph node dissection (CLND) is performed in sentinel node (SN)-positive melanoma patients, a positive non-sentinel node (NSN) is found in approximately 20% of them. Recently, Murali et al. proposed a new scoring system (non-sentinel node risk score, N-SNORE) to predict the risk of NSN positivity in SN-positive patients. The objectives of the current study were to identify factors predicting NSN positivity and to assess the validity of the N-SNORE in an independent patient cohort. METHODS: All SN-positive patients who underwent CLND at a single institution between 1995 and 2010 were analyzed. Characteristics of the patient, primary melanoma, and SN(s) were tested for association with NSN positivity. Missing values were reconstructed using multiple imputation to enable multivariable analysis. RESULTS: CLND revealed positive NSNs in 30 (23%) of 130 SN-positive patients. Primary melanoma regression (p = 0.03) was independently associated with NSN positivity. After adjustment because of missing data on perinodal lymphatic invasion, N-SNORE proved to be a significant stratification model in our patient cohort (p = 0.003): 5.9% NSN positivity in the very low risk category and 75.0% NSN positivity in the very high risk category. CONCLUSIONS: Presence of regression in the primary melanoma was independently associated with a higher risk of NSN positivity. The slightly modified N-SNORE scoring system provided useful stratification of the risk for NSN positivity. However, lack of perinodal lymphatic invasion data may have reduced its predictive value.	2b
26046020	Effect of silymarin in the prevention of Cisplatin nephrotoxicity, a clinical trial study.	BACKGROUND: Reno-protective effect of Silymarin was studied in some studies mainly on rats. In some of these studies, Silymarin was shown to have positive effects on preventing or decreasing severity of Cisplatin nephrotoxicity. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the protective effect of Silymarin on Cisplatin nephrotoxicity in adult patients with malignancy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this clinical trial study, 60 patients with malignancy, candidate of Cisplatin treatment were randomly enrolled in two equal groups. In patients of case group, Silymarin tablet 140 mg/bid was administrated seven days before Cisplatin administration together with Cisplatin, and in control group, Cisplatin was prescribed. Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN) and serum Creatinine (Cr) were checked at the same day and 3 and 7 days after administration of Cisplatin. RESULTS: Mean age of the patients in case and control groups were 51.1+/-14.3 y and 51.1+/-13.7 y respectively (p=0.99). There was no significant difference based on BUN and serum Cr in the beginning of study and three days after administration of Cisplatin in two groups of patients; however, after two weeks, BUN and serum Cr were significantly lower in the case group compared to the control group. Also, in the case group, BUN and serum Cr decreased and in the control group, they increased after two weeks after Cisplatin administration. CONCLUSION: This study showed that Silymarin can decrease Cisplatin nephrotoxicity, so because of safety profile and minor adverse effect of Silymarin, we can use it as prophylaxis against Cisplatin nephrotoxicity in various Cisplatin-contained chemotherapy regimens.	2b
24834078	The effect of massage therapy on the quality of sleep in breast cancer patients.	BACKGROUND: Annually, about 6000 new cases are diagnosed with breast cancer in Iran. In Iran, more women are affected with breast cancer than a decade earlier in comparison with other countries, and 70% of them are diagnosed at an advanced phase. Insomnia is the most common disorder following breast cancer, and interference in sleep quality and rest causes changes in physiological functions and reduces the body's daily performance. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of massage therapy on the quality of sleep in patients with breast cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This clinical trial was conducted for about 1 month in a referral chemotherapy clinic of a teaching hospital in Isfahan, Iran. The participants consisted of 57 women with breast cancer who were selected by simple random sampling. They were randomly assigned to two groups of control and experimental. The control group was treated only by usual medical therapy, whereas the case group was treated by combined medical-massage therapy. Data collection tools were the validated Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and a demographic questionnaire. Data were analyzed by SPSS using descriptive statistics, Chi-square test, paired t-test, and Student's t-test. RESULTS: The results showed significant differences in the mean scores of quality of sleep before and after the intervention in the case group, while no significant differences were observed in the mean scores of quality of sleep before and after the intervention in the control group. In addition, no significant differences were observed in the mean scores of quality of sleep before the intervention between case and control groups. However, significant differences were observed in the mean scores of quality of sleep after the intervention between case and control groups. CONCLUSION: According to the results of this study, learning and applying massage techniques by medical staff causes health promotion and improves the quality of sleep in cancer patients. Furthermore, massage therapy is suggested as a non-pharmacologic method to improve sleep quality in these patients.	2b
17531335	High dose rate brachytherapy in combination with external beam radiotherapy in the radical treatment of prostate cancer: initial results of a randomised phase three trial.	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: A randomised phase III trial has compared external beam radiotherapy alone with a dose escalated schedule using high dose rate brachytherapy. Patients with histologically confirmed prostate cancer, no evidence of metastases, a PSA <50, no previous TURP and fit for general anaesthetic were included. METHODS: Patients were randomised to receive either standard radiotherapy 55 Gy in 20 fractions treating Monday to Friday over 4 weeks or a combined schedule comprising external beam treatment delivering 35.75 Gy in 13 fractions treating daily Monday to Friday over 2.5 weeks followed by a temporary high dose rate afterloading implant delivering 17 Gy in two fractions over 24h. RESULTS: A total of 220 patients were randomised, balanced for important prognostic parameters including tumour stage, presenting PSA, Gleason score and use of adjuvant anti-androgens. With a median follow up of 30 months (range 3-91) a significant improvement in actuarial biochemical relapse-free survival is seen in favour of the combined brachytherapy schedule (p=0.03). A lower incidence of acute rectal discharge was seen in the brachytherapy group (p=0.025) and other acute and late toxicities were equivalent. Patients randomised to brachytherapy had a significantly better FACT-P score at 12 weeks (p=0.02). CONCLUSIONS: The use of high dose rate brachytherapy in combination with external beam radiotherapy resulted in an improved biochemical relapse-free survival compared to external beam radiotherapy alone with less acute rectal toxicity and improved quality of life in this randomised trial.	1a
832488	Thoracic metastasis in malignant melanoma. A radiographic survey of 65 patients.	Sixty-five patients with malignant melanoma metastatic to the thorax were evaluated retrospectively. Chest x-ray films showed abnormalities in 63 patients and provided the first evidence of dissemination in 42 of the 62 with widespread metastasis. Frequent radiographic follow-up evaluations of patients with primary melanoma is necessary to detect metastasis at an early stage. Pulmonary metastasis was seen radiographically in almost 90 percent of the patients. Snowstorm metastasis denotes a poorer prognosis than other patterns of pulmonary involvement. Enlargement of mediastinal lymph nodes, bronchial obstruction with atelectasis, pleural effusion, bone metastasis with an extrapleural mass, and cardiomegally were also seen. Follow-up chest x-ray films are of limited value in evaluating patients once they are found to have thoracic metastasis. The rate of growth of metastatic lesions or the regression of the metastasis does not correlate with survival.	4
26110555	Repeated isolated limb perfusion in melanoma patients with recurrent in-transit metastases.	In-transit metastases of melanoma occur in 5-8% of all melanoma patients. In case of extensive locoregional disease, Tumor necrosis factor-alpha and melphalan-based isolated limb perfusion (TM-ILP) had proven to yield excellent local control. Here, we report on repeat TM-ILP for locoregional recurrence after isolated limb perfusion. Between 1991 and 2013, 37 consecutive repeat TM-ILPs were analyzed in 32 different patients. Three patients underwent a third TM-ILP. During a median follow-up of 20 months after repeat TM-ILP, the overall response rate was 86%. Complete response (CR) was recorded after 24 TM-ILPs (65%). CR after first TM-ILP was a strong predictor for successful repeat TM-ILP in terms of clinical response and local recurrence. Local toxicity was mild (70% Wieberdink I-II). The local recurrence rate was 59%. Five-year overall survival was 35%. Repeat TM-ILP is a safe treatment modality in melanoma patients with recurrent in-transit metastases of melanoma. Those with a CR after first TM-ILP benefit the most from repeat TM-ILP.	4
21896421	Quality of life in melanoma patients during adjuvant treatment with pegylated interferon-alpha2b: patients' and doctors' views.	Treatment of malignant melanoma with IFN-alpha has been associated with significant side-effects. The aim of this retrospective monocentric non-randomized study was first to evaluate the impact on quality of life (QOL) in 30 melanoma patients treated with once weekly 2 mug/kg PEG-IFN-alpha2b for 18 months, and second to examine whether there is a difference in patients' and physicians' perception of QOL. Data on QOL were collected by means of the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire completed by the patient before consultation at baseline and every three months during treatment. A second questionnaire was filled out independently by the physician, based on the consultation and patient file. All data were routinely collected in an outpatient care unit. At baseline, patients had more favorable mean values on almost all dimensions of the EORTC QLQ-C30 than follow-up assessments. In comparison to published low-dose IFN-alpha2a data, once weekly 2 mug/kg PEG-IFN-alpha2b was associated with stronger impairment in most QOL single dimensions but with almost no differences regarding the global health status. QOL documented by physicians was significantly higher than QOL from the patients' questionnaires in all QOL dimensions (p&#60;0.05). PEG-IFN-alpha2b has measurable effects on QOL. Measuring QOL based only on physicians' patient files without explicitly determining patients' assessments leads to a profound underestimation of impairment of QOL.	4
22347607	Vitamin e reduces superficial bladder cancer recurrence: a randomized controlled trial.	BACKGROUND: Most patients with superficial bladder cancer who undergo transurethral resection of bladder tumor show recurrence of the disease. So far, there have been numerous studies on ways to decrease bladder cancer recurrence, including the intake of vitamins and antioxidants. The goal of this study was to investigate the effect of vitamin E on the recurrence of non-invasive bladder cancer. METHODS: In this randomized controlled trial, 46 patients with a single, low-grade, superficial bladder cancer, less than 3 cm in diameter, were randomly divided into two groups of vitamin E intake (400 IU daily) and no intake of vitamin E. Ultrasound and urinalysis were performed every three months to detect bladder cancer recurrence. RESULTS: There was no significant difference between the groups in age, tumor size, mean time to recurrence, and follow-up time. There recurrence rate was 28.3% throughout the follow-up period (19% in the study group and 36% in the controls) (CI=0.19 - 0.92, RR=0.53, CI=0.11 - 0.94, OR=0.42, P=0.04). In both groups, most (69.2%) of the recurrences occurred during the first year.The rate of recurrence decreased in smokers from 50% in the study group to 25% in the control group (P=0.06) and from 26.7% to 15.4% in the non-smokers in the control and study groups, respectively (P=0.15). CONCLUSION: Intake of vitamin E significantly decreased bladder cancer recurrence, especially among smokers, possibly due to higher levels of oxidants, which vitamin E may target in smokers.The trial registry code: IRCT201105235527N2.	2b
15994152	Multicenter study of a frozen glove to prevent docetaxel-induced onycholysis and cutaneous toxicity of the hand.	PURPOSE: Onycholysis and skin toxicity occur in approximately 30% of patients treated with docetaxel. We investigated the efficacy and safety of an Elasto-Gel (84400 APT Cedex, Akromed, France) frozen glove (FG) for the prevention of docetaxel-induced onycholysis and skin toxicity. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients receiving docetaxel 75 mg/m2 alone or in combination chemotherapy were eligible for this case-control study. Each patient wore an FG for a total of 90 minutes on the right hand. The left hand was not protected and acted as the control. Onycholysis and skin toxicity were assessed at each cycle by National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria and documented by photography. Wilcoxon matched-pairs rank test was used. RESULTS: Between August 2002 and September 2003, 45 patients were evaluated. Onycholysis and skin toxicity were significantly lower in the FG-protected hand compared with the control hand (P = .0001). Onycholysis was grade (G) 0 in 89% v 49% and G1 to 2 in 11% v 51% for the FG-protected hand and the control hand, respectively. Skin toxicity was G0 in 73% v 41% and G1 to 2 in 27% v 59% for the FG-protected and the control hand, respectively. Median time to nail and skin toxicity occurrence was not significantly different between the FG-protected and the control hand, respectively (106 v 58 days for nail toxicity; 57 v 58 days for skin toxicity). Five patients (11%) experienced discomfort due to cold intolerance. CONCLUSION: FG significantly reduces the nail and skin toxicity associated with docetaxel and provides a new tool in supportive care management to improve a patient's quality of life.	3a
29221446	A systematic review of test accuracy studies evaluating molecular micro-satellite instability testing for the detection of individuals with lynch syndrome.	BACKGROUND: A systematic review was conducted to assess the diagnostic test accuracy of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based microsatellite instability (MSI) testing for identifying Lynch syndrome in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). Unlike previous reviews, this was based on assessing MSI testing against best practice for the reference standard, and included CRC populations that were unselected, age-limited or high-risk for Lynch syndrome. METHODS: Single- and two-gate diagnostic test accuracy studies, or similar, were identified, assessed for inclusion, data extracted and quality appraised by two reviewers according to a pre-specified protocol. Sensitivity of MSI testing was estimated for all included studies. Specificity, likelihood ratios and predictive values were estimated for studies that were not based on high-risk samples. Narrative synthesis was conducted. RESULTS: Nine study samples were included. When MSI-Low results were considered to be negative, sensitivity estimates ranged from 67% (95% CI 47, 83) to 100% (95% CI 94, 100). Three studies contributed to estimates of both sensitivity and specificity, with specificity ranging from 61% (95% CI 57, 65), to 93% (95% CI 89, 95). Good sensitivity was achieved at the expense of specificity. When MSI-L was considered to be positive (effectively lowering the threshold for a positive index test result) sensitivity increased and specificity decreased. Between-study heterogeneity in both the MSI and reference standard testing, combined with the low number of studies contributing to both sensitivity and specificity estimates, precluded pooling by meta-analysis. CONCLUSIONS: MSI testing is an effective screening test for Lynch syndrome. However, there is significant uncertainty surrounding what balance of sensitivity and specificity will be achieved in clinical practice and how this relates to specific characteristics of the test (such as the panel of markers used or the thresholds used to denote a positive test).	3a
21849913	The role of positron emission tomography with computed tomography in the follow-up of asymptomatic cutaneous malignant melanoma patients with a high risk of disease recurrence.	The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of [F] fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) as a surveillance tool in asymptomatic patients with primary cutaneous melanoma with the American Joint Committee on Cancer stage 3 disease. Thirty-four patients with primary cutaneous malignant melanoma with American Joint Committee on Cancer stage 3 disease, who underwent at least one annual surveillance PET/CT scan, were retrospectively identified from our PET Centre Database in May 2008 and their characteristics, PET/CT results and disease course were reviewed. In 20 patients with microscopic stage 3 disease at diagnosis, annual surveillance PET/CT detected two of three recurrences and detected one incidental breast carcinoma. In 14 patients with macroscopic stage 3 disease at, or subsequent to, their initial diagnosis, annual PET/CT detected four of four recurrences, detected metastases in one patient who remains asymptomatic and detected one incidental thyroid carcinoma. PET/CT seems to be a useful surveillance tool in patients with macroscopic stage 3 disease, although the numbers in this study are small. However, the role of PET/CT in patients initially presenting with microscopic stage 3 disease requires further confirmation.	4
20850370	Swallowing outcomes following Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) for head & neck cancer - a systematic review.	PURPOSE: A systematic review to establish what evidence is available for swallowing outcomes following IMRT for head and neck cancer. METHODS: Online electronic databases were searched to identify papers published in English from January 1998 to December 2009. Papers were independently appraised by two reviewers for methodological quality, method of swallowing evaluation and categorized according to the World Health Organisation's International Classification of Health Functions. The impact of radiation dose to dysphagia aspiration risk structures (DARS) was also evaluated. RESULTS: Sixteen papers met the inclusion criteria. The literature suggests that limiting the radiation dose to certain structures may result in favourable swallowing outcomes. Methodological limitations included variable assessment methods and outcome measures and heterogeneity of patients. There are only limited prospective data, especially where pre-treatment measures have been taken and compared to serial post-treatment assessment. CONCLUSIONS: Few studies have investigated the impact of IMRT on swallow function and the impact on everyday life. Initial studies have reported potential benefits but are limited in terms of study design and outcome data. Further well designed, prospective, longitudinal swallowing studies including multidimensional evaluation methods are required to enable a more comprehensive understanding of dysphagia complications and inform pre-treatment counselling and rehabilitation planning.	2b
22992358	Mailed intervention to promote sun protection of children: a randomized controlled trial.	BACKGROUND: Sun exposure, especially during childhood, is the most important preventable risk factor for skin cancer, yet few effective interventions to reduce exposure exist. PURPOSE: To test the effectiveness of a partially tailored mailed intervention based on the Precaution Adoption Process Model, delivered in the spring over 3 years to parents and children. DESIGN: RCT, with data collection through telephone interviews of parents and skin exams of children at baseline (Summer 2004) and annually (Summer 2005-2007). The control group received no intervention. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Families recruited in the Denver CO area, through private pediatric clinics, a large MCO, and community settings. Children born in 1998 were approximately 6 years of age at baseline; 867 children met inclusion criteria; analysis is reported for 677 white, non-Hispanic participants at highest risk for skin cancer. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcomes were parent-reported child sun protection behaviors. Secondary outcomes included parents' risk perception, perceived effectiveness of and barriers to prevention behaviors, stage of change, reported sunburns, and observed tanning and nevus development. The longitudinal mixed-model analysis was conducted between 2008 and 2011. RESULTS: The intervention group reported more use of sunscreen, protective clothing, hats, shade-seeking, and midday sun avoidance; fewer sunburns; more awareness of the risk of skin cancer; higher perceived effectiveness of sun protection; higher stage of change; and lower perception of barriers to sun protection (all p<0.05). The intervention group had fewer nevi >/=2 mm in 1 year of the study, 2006 (p=0.03). No differences were found in tanning or nevi <2 mm. CONCLUSIONS: The level of behavior change associated with this single-modality intervention is not likely sufficient to reduce skin cancer risk. However, the intervention shows promise for inclusion in longer-term, multicomponent interventions that have sufficient intensity to affect skin cancer incidence.	1a
28708236	Psychosocial interventions for fatigue during cancer treatment with palliative intent.	BACKGROUND: Fatigue is a prevalent and burdensome symptom for patients with incurable cancer receiving cancer treatment with palliative intent and is associated with reduced quality of life. Psychosocial interventions seem promising for management of fatigue among cancer patients. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of psychosocial interventions for fatigue in adult patients with incurable cancer receiving cancer treatment with palliative intent. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the following databases: CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and seven clinical trial registries; we also searched the reference lists of articles. The date of our most recent search was 29 November 2016. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials that compared psychosocial interventions in adults aged 18 years or over undergoing cancer treatment with palliative intent for incurable cancer versus usual care or other controls. Psychosocial interventions were defined as various kinds of interventions provided to influence or change cognitions, emotions, behaviours, social interactions, or a combination of these. Psychosocial interventions of interest to this review had to involve at least two interactions between the patient and the care provider in which the care provider gave the patient personal feedback concerning changes sought by these interventions. We included trials that reported fatigue as an outcome of interest. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Two review authors independently considered trials for inclusion in the review, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data, including information on adverse events. We assessed the quality of evidence using GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) and created a 'Summary of findings' table. MAIN RESULTS: We identified 14 studies (16 reports) that met inclusion criteria for this review and involved 3077 randomised participants in total. Most of these studies included a mixed sample of participants; we obtained data for the subset of interest for this review (diagnosis of incurable cancer and receiving cancer treatment) from the study investigators of 12 studies, for which we included 535 participants in the subset meta-analysis for fatigue post intervention. Researchers investigated a broad range of psychosocial interventions with different intervention aims and durations. We identified sources of potential bias, including lack of description of methods of blinding and allocation concealment and inclusion of small study populations.Findings from our meta-analysis do not support the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions for reducing fatigue post intervention (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.25, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.50 to 0.00; not significant; 535 participants, 12 studies; very low-quality evidence). First follow-up findings on fatigue suggested benefit for participants assigned to the psychosocial intervention compared with control (SMD -0.66, 95% CI -1.00 to -0.32; 147 participants, four studies; very low-quality evidence), which was not sustained at second follow-up (SMD -0.41, 95% CI -1.12 to 0.30; not significant; very low-quality evidence).Results for our secondary outcomes revealed very low-quality evidence for the efficacy of psychosocial interventions in improving physical functioning post intervention (SMD 0.32, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.63; 307 participants, seven studies). These findings were not sustained at first follow-up (SMD 0.37, 95% CI -0.20 to 0.94; not significant; 122 participants, two studies; very low-quality evidence). Findings do not support the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions for improving social functioning (mean difference (MD) 4.16, 95% CI -11.20 to 19.53; not significant; 141 participants, four studies), role functioning (MD 3.49, 95% CI -12.78 to 19.76; not significant; 143 participants, four studies), emotional functioning (SMD -0.11, 95% CI -0.56 to 0.35; not significant; 115 participants, three studies), or cognitive functioning (MD -2.23, 95% CI -12.52 to 8.06; not significant; 86 participants, two studies) post intervention. Only three studies evaluated adverse events. These studies found no difference between the number of adverse events among participants in the intervention versus control group.Using GRADE, we considered the overall quality of evidence for our primary and secondary outcomes to be very low. Therefore, we have very little confidence in the effect estimate, and the true effect is likely to be substantially different from the estimate of effect. Limitations in study quality and imprecision due to sparse data resulted in downgrading of the quality of data. Additionally, most studies were at high risk of bias owing to their small sample size for the subset of patients with incurable cancer (fewer than 50 participants per arm), leading to uncertainty about effect estimates. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We found little evidence around the benefits of psychosocial interventions provided to reduce fatigue in adult patients with incurable cancer receiving cancer treatment with palliative intent. Additional studies with larger samples are required to assess whether psychosocial interventions are beneficial for addressing fatigue in patients with incurable cancer.	1a
9536902	Ultrasound diagnosis of metastatic melanoma of the gallbladder.	The abdominal ultrasound examinations of 464 patients with malignant melanoma performed over a 3 year period were reviewed. 23 (5.2%) had soft tissue material attached to the gallbladder wall and projecting into the lumen. Four of these were polyps of less than 1 cm which were thought to be benign, while the remaining 19 had abnormalities likely to be metastatic melanoma. Upper abdominal ultrasound examinations are frequently requested for staging purposes in patients with thick high grade malignant melanoma or clinical suspicion of metastases. Ultrasound clearly identifies the gallbladder and biliary tree in the vast majority of patients and is generally regarded as the imaging modality of choice for suspected gallbladder pathology. As autopsy studies have confirmed the incidence of gallbladder metastases from malignant melanoma to be 15-20%, a careful review of the gallbladder is advocated when abdominal ultrasound examinations are performed on patients with malignant melanoma.	4
31337882	Cancer risks by gene, age, and gender in 6350 carriers of pathogenic mismatch repair variants: findings from the Prospective Lynch Syndrome Database.	PURPOSE: Pathogenic variants affecting MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2 cause Lynch syndrome and result in different but imprecisely known cancer risks. This study aimed to provide age and organ-specific cancer risks according to gene and gender and to determine survival after cancer. METHODS: We conducted an international, multicenter prospective observational study using independent test and validation cohorts of carriers of class 4 or class 5 variants. After validation the cohorts were merged providing 6350 participants and 51,646 follow-up years. RESULTS: There were 1808 prospectively observed cancers. Pathogenic MLH1 and MSH2 variants caused high penetrance dominant cancer syndromes sharing similar colorectal, endometrial, and ovarian cancer risks, but older MSH2 carriers had higher risk of cancers of the upper urinary tract, upper gastrointestinal tract, brain, and particularly prostate. Pathogenic MSH6 variants caused a sex-limited trait with high endometrial cancer risk but only modestly increased colorectal cancer risk in both genders. We did not demonstrate a significantly increased cancer risk in carriers of pathogenic PMS2 variants. Ten-year crude survival was over 80% following colon, endometrial, or ovarian cancer. CONCLUSION: Management guidelines for Lynch syndrome may require revision in light of these different gene and gender-specific risks and the good prognosis for the most commonly associated cancers.	3a
25077452	Electroacupuncture for fatigue, sleep, and psychological distress in breast cancer patients with aromatase inhibitor-related arthralgia: a randomized trial.	BACKGROUND: Although fatigue, sleep disturbance, depression, and anxiety are associated with pain in breast cancer patients, it is unknown whether acupuncture can decrease these comorbid symptoms in cancer patients with pain. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of electroacupuncture (EA) on fatigue, sleep, and psychological distress in breast cancer survivors who experience joint pain related to aromatase inhibitors (AIs). METHODS: The authors performed a randomized controlled trial of an 8-week course of EA compared with a waitlist control (WLC) group and a sham acupuncture (SA) group in postmenopausal women with breast cancer who self-reported joint pain attributable to AIs. Fatigue, sleep disturbance, anxiety, and depression were measured using the Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI), the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). The effects of EA and SA versus WLC on these outcomes were evaluated using mixed-effects models. RESULTS: Of the 67 randomly assigned patients, baseline pain interference was associated with fatigue (Pearson correlation coefficient [r]=0.75; P < .001), sleep disturbance (r=0.38; P=.0026), and depression (r=0.58; P < .001). Compared with the WLC condition, EA produced significant improvements in fatigue (P=.0095), anxiety (P=.044), and depression (P=.015) and a nonsignificant improvement in sleep disturbance (P=.058) during the 12-week intervention and follow-up period. In contrast, SA did not produce significant reductions in fatigue or anxiety symptoms but did produce a significant improvement in depression compared with the WLC condition (P=.0088). CONCLUSIONS: Compared with usual care, EA produced significant improvements in fatigue, anxiety, and depression; whereas SA improved only depression in women experiencing AI-related arthralgia.	1b
10883899	Surgical treatment of brain metastases from melanoma: a retrospective study of 91 patients.	OBJECT: Reports on the surgical treatment of brain metastases from melanoma in a large group of patients are sparse. The goal of this paper is to review the surgical experience in a series of 91 patients with brain metastases from primary melanoma treated at a single institution. METHODS: Seven hundred eighty patients underwent resection of brain metastases at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center between 1974 and 1994. The records of 91 (11.7%) of these patients who had melanoma were retrospectively reviewed. The median time from diagnosis of the primary melanoma to diagnosis of the brain lesion was 14.1 months. The overall median length of survival following craniotomy was 6.7 months. Fifteen patients with resected multiple metastases had shorter median survival times than 76 patients with a single lesion (5.4 months compared with 7.8 months, p = 0.12). In eight patients with cerebellar metastases the median length of survival was significantly shorter than that found in patients with supratentorial lesions (2 compared with 7 months, p = 0.03). There was no difference in length of survival between 49 patients who underwent postoperative whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT) and 29 patients who did not (9.5 compared with 8.3 months, p = 0.67). The incidence of brain metastasis recurrences in WBRT-treated and untreated patients was similar (56% and 45.7%, respectively). Only the presence of infratentorial metastases (p = 0.0013) and unresected recurrence of brain metastases (p = 0.0003) had an impact on outcome according to a Cox regression analysis. Five patients (5.5%) died within 31 days of surgery. Overall survival rates at 1, 2, 3, and 5 years were 36.3, 18.7, 13.2, and 6.6%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Although melanoma metastatic to the brain carries a foreboding prognosis, patients who do not display preoperative neurological deficits, harbor a single lesion situated supratentorially, and have no lung or visceral metastases may derive significant palliative benefit from surgical resection of brain metastases.	3b
11391592	A micromorphometry-based concept for routine classification of sentinel lymph node metastases and its clinical relevance for patients with melanoma.	BACKGROUND: The sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) as the primary targets for lymphatic metastases can be removed selectively by gamma probe-guided sentinel lymph nodectomy (SLNE) in nearly all patients with cutaneous melanoma. Correspondingly high standards in terms of specificity, sensitivity, and microstaging are required for the evaluation of SLNs. METHODS: Since 1995, the authors have performed SLNE in 389 lymph node regions (LNRs) on 342 patients with melanoma. The harvested 636 SLNs and a further 1394 nonsentinel lymph nodes (non-SLNs) were evaluated by standardized, semiserial section histology, including immunohistochemistry. For each LNR, this technique permitted routine S classification using two simple morphometric parameters: the number of tumor-involved, 1-mm slices of the SLNs (n) and the centripetal depth of metastatic cell invasion (d). S1 was defined by 1 < or = n < or = 2 and d < or = 1 mm, equivalent to localized peripheral tumor cell deposits; S2 was defined by n > 2 and d < or = 1 mm, indicating more extended peripheral metastases; S3 was defined by d > 1 mm in SNLs with deeper metastatic infiltration; and S0 meant no detectable tumor cells (n = 0). RESULTS: The authors diagnosed 325 SLNs as S0, 24 SLNs as S1, 22 SLNs as S2, and 18 SLNs as S3. The occurrence of at least one melanoma-positive non-SLN subsequent regional completion lymph node dissection (RCLND) significantly increased from 0 of 12 in S1 SLNs to 2 of 13 in S2 SLNs and 9 of 15 in S3 SLNs (P = 0.001; chi-square test). Like the T classification of the primary melanoma, the S classification proved to be a highly significant predictor for distant metastasis (P < 0.001). It turned out to be an independent factor of influence on distant metastasis and survival in multivariate Cox analyses, which included tumor thickness, primary tumor site, patient gender, and patient age as covariates. CONCLUSIONS: The data presented recommend the S-staging concept as a promising option to fill a gap between the T and conventional N component of the pTNM classification. If its predictive capacity can be confirmed in multicenter studies, then the S classification may become the decisive criterion for or against RCLND, and a combined T plus S staging system will help to improve prognostically relevant stratification of melanoma patients in adjuvant therapy trials.	3b
22033849	Transarterial hepatic chemoperfusion of uveal melanoma metastases: survival and response to treatment.	PURPOSE: To assess the survival of patients with hepatic uveal melanoma metastases undergoing sequential transarterial hepatic chemoperfusion. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 61 patients (mean age, 60.3 +/- 13.8 y) underwent a total of 249 hepatic chemoperfusion procedures (mean: 4 chemoperfusion procedures; range, 1-7 chemoperfusion procedures; standard deviation, 2.3 chemoperfusion procedures). All patients started with melphalan. In the case of progressive disease, melphalan was replaced by a different chemoperfusion agent. 38 patients were treated with melphalan only, 23 patients were treated with a combination of melphalan and other drugs. The median overall survival time was calculated for the overall population and several sub-groups. Differences in the survival rate between the sub-groups were assessed for statistical significance. The complication rate was assessed. RESULTS: The median overall survival of the entire population was 10 months. The patients in the subgroups with a maximum number of 9 hepatic metastases as well as the patients in the subgroup without extrahepatic metastases at the beginning of therapy survived significantly longer than patients with more than 9 metastases/extrahepatic metastases (p = 0.019, p = 0.008). One patient (0.4%) died from liver failure after initial infusion of melphalan. CONCLUSION: Intraarterial sequential hepatic chemoperfusion offers a minimally invasive treatment in patients with hepatic uveal melanoma metastases with good survival times and an acceptable major complication rate.	4
10382187	The Index of Nausea, Vomiting, and Retching: a new format of the lndex of Nausea and Vomiting.	PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES: To determine the reliability of the Index of Nausea, Vomiting, and Retching (INVR), a new format of the Rhodes Index of Nausea and Vomiting Form 2 (INV-2). DESIGN AND SETTING: A parallel form study was conducted at a large, Midwestern teaching hospital and a cancer center. SAMPLE: Convenience sample of 159 subjects: 40 obstetrical, 60 oncological, 59 medical/surgical. METHODS: Two instruments, the INVR and the INV-2, were administered approximately 30-60 minutes apart. One-half of the subjects completed the INVR first, and the other half completed the INV-2 first. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Equivalency measures of reliability correlation coefficients for both instruments. FINDINGS: A high rate of agreement was found in the responses between the two forms. In cases of clear disagreement, the responses to the INVR were more frequently consistent than the responses to the original form. CONCLUSIONS: INVR has tested reliability and is more user friendly for the patient and the healthcare provider. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE: Nurses have a focal role in managing symptoms. Managing nausea, vomiting, and retching requires excellent assessment skills of the patient's personal symptom experience and knowledge of pharmacology. Efficient, cost-saving assessments require accurate self-report instruments that permit patients to quantify their symptom experiences. The INVR can provide a scientific base from which to prescribe and teach patients and may improve their quality of life. Reliable and valid self-reporting instruments are essential for managing these adverse symptoms.	3a
20071702	Preoperative biliary drainage for cancer of the head of the pancreas.	BACKGROUND: The benefits of preoperative biliary drainage, which was introduced to improve the postoperative outcome in patients with obstructive jaundice caused by a tumor of the pancreatic head, are unclear. METHODS: In this multicenter, randomized trial, we compared preoperative biliary drainage with surgery alone for patients with cancer of the pancreatic head. Patients with obstructive jaundice and a bilirubin level of 40 to 250 micromol per liter (2.3 to 14.6 mg per deciliter) were randomly assigned to undergo either preoperative biliary drainage for 4 to 6 weeks, followed by surgery, or surgery alone within 1 week after diagnosis. Preoperative biliary drainage was attempted primarily with the placement of an endoprosthesis by means of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. The primary outcome was the rate of serious complications within 120 days after randomization. RESULTS: We enrolled 202 patients; 96 were assigned to undergo early surgery and 106 to undergo preoperative biliary drainage; 6 patients were excluded from the analysis. The rates of serious complications were 39% (37 patients) in the early-surgery group and 74% (75 patients) in the biliary-drainage group (relative risk in the early-surgery group, 0.54; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.41 to 0.71; P<0.001). Preoperative biliary drainage was successful in 96 patients (94%) after one or more attempts, with complications in 47 patients (46%). Surgery-related complications occurred in 35 patients (37%) in the early-surgery group and in 48 patients (47%) in the biliary-drainage group (relative risk, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.57 to 1.11; P=0.14). Mortality and the length of hospital stay did not differ significantly between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Routine preoperative biliary drainage in patients undergoing surgery for cancer of the pancreatic head increases the rate of complications.

20564107	High response rate after intratumoral treatment with interleukin-2: results from a phase 2 study in 51 patients with metastasized melanoma.	BACKGROUND: Systemic high-dose interleukin-2 (IL-2) achieved long-term survival in a subset of patients with advanced melanoma. The authors reported previously that intratumorally applied IL-2 induced complete local responses of all metastases in >60% of patients. The objectives of the current study were to confirm those results in a larger cohort and to identify patient or regimen characteristics associated with response. METHODS: Patients with melanoma who had a median of 12 injectable metastases received intratumoral IL-2 treatments 3 times weekly until they achieved clinical remission. The initial dose of 3 million international units was escalated, depending on the individual patient's tolerance. RESULTS: Forty-eight of 51 patients were evaluable. Only grade 1/2 toxicity was recorded. A complete response that lasted >/=6 months was documented in 70% of all injected metastases. A complete local response of all treated metastases was achieved in 33 patients (69%), including 11 patients who had between 20 and 100 metastases. Response rates were higher for patients who had stage III disease compared with patients who had stage IV disease. No objective responses of distant untreated metastases were observed. The 2-year survival rate was 77% for patients with stage IIIB/IIIC disease and 53% for patients with stage IV disease. Efficacy and survival did not differ between patients who had >/=20 lesions and patients who had <20 lesions. CONCLUSIONS: Intratumoral IL-2 treatment elicited complete local responses in a high percentage of patients. Further studies will be required to investigate the mode of action of this treatment and its impact on survival.	4
29477665	Adjuvant vemurafenib in resected, BRAF(V600) mutation-positive melanoma (BRIM8): a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre, phase 3 trial.	BACKGROUND: Systemic adjuvant treatment might mitigate the high risk of disease recurrence in patients with resected stage IIC-III melanoma. The BRIM8 study evaluated adjuvant vemurafenib monotherapy in patients with resected, BRAF(V600) mutation-positive melanoma. METHODS: BRIM8 was a phase 3, international, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled study that enrolled 498 adults (aged >/=18 years) with histologically confirmed stage IIC-IIIA-IIIB (cohort 1) or stage IIIC (cohort 2) BRAF(V600) mutation-positive melanoma that was fully resected. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) by an interactive voice or web response system to receive twice-daily adjuvant oral vemurafenib 960 mg tablets or matching placebo for 52 weeks (13 x 28-day cycles). Randomisation was done by permuted blocks (block size 6) and was stratified by pathological stage and region in cohort 1 and by region in cohort 2. The investigators, patients, and sponsor were masked to treatment assignment. The primary endpoint was disease-free survival in the intention-to-treat population, evaluated separately in each cohort. Hierarchical analysis of cohort 2 before cohort 1 was prespecified. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01667419. FINDINGS: The study enrolled 184 patients in cohort 2 (93 were assigned to vemurafenib and 91 to placebo) and 314 patients in cohort 1 (157 were assigned to vemurafenib and 157 to placebo). At the time of data cutoff (April 17, 2017), median study follow-up was 33.5 months (IQR 25.9-41.6) in cohort 2 and 30.8 months (25.5-40.7) in cohort 1. In cohort 2 (patients with stage IIIC disease), median disease-free survival was 23.1 months (95% CI 18.6-26.5) in the vemurafenib group versus 15.4 months (11.1-35.9) in the placebo group (hazard ratio [HR] 0.80, 95% CI 0.54-1.18; log-rank p=0.26). In cohort 1 (patients with stage IIC-IIIA-IIIB disease) median disease-free survival was not reached (95% CI not estimable) in the vemurafenib group versus 36.9 months (21.4-not estimable) in the placebo group (HR 0.54 [95% CI 0.37-0.78]; log-rank p=0.0010); however, the result was not significant because of the prespecified hierarchical prerequisite for the primary disease-free survival analysis of cohort 2 to show a significant disease-free survival benefit. Grade 3-4 adverse events occurred in 141 (57%) of 247 patients in the vemurafenib group and 37 (15%) of 247 patients in the placebo group. The most common grade 3-4 adverse events in the vemurafenib group were keratoacanthoma (24 [10%] of 247 patients), arthralgia (17 [7%]), squamous cell carcinoma (17 [7%]), rash (14 [6%]), and elevated alanine aminotransferase (14 [6%]), although all keratoacanthoma events and most squamous cell carcinoma events were by default graded as grade 3. In the placebo group, grade 3-4 adverse events did not exceed 2% for any of the reported terms. Serious adverse events were reported in 40 (16%) of 247 patients in the vemurafenib group and 25 (10%) of 247 patients in the placebo group. The most common serious adverse event was basal cell carcinoma, which was reported in eight (3%) patients in each group. One patient in the vemurafenib group of cohort 2 died 2 months after admission to hospital for grade 3 hypertension; however, this death was not considered to be related to the study drug. INTERPRETATION: The primary endpoint of disease-free survival was not met in cohort 2, and therefore the analysis of cohort 1 showing a numerical benefit in disease-free survival with vemurafenib versus placebo in patients with resected stage IIC-IIIA-IIIB BRAF(V600) mutation-positive melanoma must be considered exploratory only. 1 year of adjuvant vemurafenib was well tolerated, but might not be an optimal treatment regimen in this patient population.

9191522	Prolonged survival of 2 years or longer for patients with disseminated melanoma. An analysis of related prognostic factors.	BACKGROUND: Once melanoma has metastasized to distant sites, the prognosis is usually poor, showing an overall median survival of 6-8 months. Long term survival is extremely rare, and there is still controversy concerning the prognostic significance of therapeutic modalities. The aim of the current study was to identify important prognostic factors associated with Stage IV melanoma. METHODS: The current study was based on data for 3258 melanoma patients, for whom clinical, pathologic, and long term follow-up information was recorded during the period 1976-1996 at the Eberhard-Karls-University in Tuebingen. Germany. The attainment of 2 years' or longer survival time by patients with disseminated melanoma was addressed, and a multivariate analysis of related prognostic factors was performed by logistic regression. RESULTS: Four hundred forty-two patients (13.6%) developed distant metastasis. The median survival time was 7 months, and the 2-year, 5-year, and 10-year survival rates were 11.9%, 6.7%, and 4.7%, respectively. Forty-five patients had prolonged survival of 2 years or longer. Significantly more females belonged to the group of long term survivors (P = 0.0186). Of the modalities of therapy given, only surgery was associated with prolonged survival (P < 0.0001). Primary metastasis to the skin (P = 0.006), the brain (P = 0.015), more than a single metastatic site (P = 0.002), and Karnofsky performance status of less than 80 (P = 0.0035) were significantly related to short term survival. In addition, subsequent development of two or more new metastatic sites was also associated with short term survival (P = 0.0025). CONCLUSIONS: In the current analysis, prolonged survival of 2 years or longer for patients with disseminated melanoma was shown to depend on gender, site of primary metastasis, number of metastatic sites, and Karnofsky performance status. Of the modalities of therapy given, only surgery significantly influenced survival. However, in a small percentage of patients, long term complete remission was achieved with chemotherapy alone or in combination with surgery, suggesting that such regimens might be curative in selected cases.	2b
29909967	Tips and tricks to improve sentinel lymph node mapping with Indocyanin green in endometrial cancer.	"OBJECTIVE: To determine the validity of sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy with ICG in endometrial cancer and to evaluate the factors associated with poor mapping or false negative. METHODS: We reviewed all patients who underwent primary surgery for endometrial carcinoma with SLN mapping using ICG followed by pelvic lymphadenectomy from February 2014 to December 2015. SLNs were ultrastaged on final pathology. Patients' demographics, surgical approach and histopathological factors were prospectively collected. Detection rate, sensitivity and negative predictive value (NPV) were calculated and univariate analysis was performed to evaluate factors associated with failed bilateral detection of SLNs. RESULTS: A total of 119 patients were included. The overall and bilateral detection rates were 93% and 74%. Sensitivity and NPV were 100% in patients with bilateral detection; 95% and 99% respectively in cases with at least unilateral detection. Advanced FIGO stage (III or IV) was the only factor related to failed bilateral detection (p=0.01). In 14 hemi-pelvis, the specimen labelled as SLN did not contain nodal tissue on final pathology (only lymphatic channels), which represented 37% of the ""failed detection"" cases. One false negative occurred in a patient with an ipsilateral clinically suspicious enlarged lymph node. CONCLUSION: ICG is an excellent tracer for SLN mapping in endometrial cancer. Advanced FIGO stage correlated with failed bilateral detection (p=0.01). Suspicious lymph nodes should be removed regardless of the mapping. Care should be taken to ensure that SLN specimen actually contains nodal tissue and not only swollen lymphatic channels, as this represents a significant cause of failed SLN mapping."	4
18498012	Electrochemotherapy with intravenous bleomycin in the local treatment of skin melanoma metastases.	BACKGROUND: Electrochemotherapy (ECT) combines chemotherapy and electroporation to increase drug uptake. Its role in cutaneous melanoma metastasis treatment is not well defined; indeed, few studies have been reported, without complete follow-up data. AIM: To prospectively evaluate clinical activity and tolerability of ECT with i.v. bleomycin, and to analyze the response increase associated to repeated sessions, in the largest series of cutaneous melanoma metastases reported to date (n = 233). PATIENTS AND METHODS: 14 stage III relapsed/refractory patients were enrolled according to European Standard Operating Procedures of Electrochemotherapy (ESOPE) guidelines and treated under general sedation using the Cliniporator(TM) pulse generator. RESULTS: A response was obtained in 13/14 patients (93%) after the first ECT, with a complete regression (CR) in 7 (50%). Seven patients underwent a second and three a third ECT on newly appearing and residual lesions, all achieving a response. Overall, a response was obtained in 93% metastases, with lower response rates in >1 cm(2) lesions. The CR rate was 58%; none of the CR nodules relapsed. The repeated ECT sessions gave rise to a new response in 21/29 (72%) re-treated lesions. The local tumor control rate was 74.5% at 2 years. CONCLUSION: ECT is a safe procedure, easily performed in terms of toxicities and cost-effectiveness ratios, and constitutes a therapeutic tool for relapsed/refractory cutaneous melanoma patients. The repeated ECT sessions are associated with a response increase in re-treated lesions which could allow to overcome the reduced activity in >1 cm(2) sized metastases.	4
24053483	Soy and soy isoflavones in prostate cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.	OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the efficacy and safety of soy/isoflavones in men with prostate cancer (PCa) or with a clinically identified risk of PCa. PATIENTS AND METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Allied and Complementary Medicine (AMED), the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) and the Cochrane Library databases were searched. We identified RCTs investigating soy/soy isoflavones as dietary supplements or dietary components for the secondary prevention or treatment of PCa in men with PCa or with a clinically identified risk of developing PCa. Studies of multi-component formulations were excluded. Six authors were contacted for further information for the meta-analyses. Methodological quality was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration's risk-of- bias tool. The PRISMA statement for reporting systematic reviews was followed. RESULTS: Of the eight RCTs that met the inclusion criteria, six restricted recruitment to men diagnosed with PCa, while two included men with clinically identified risk of PCa. A large degree of heterogeneity was found with respect to dosages and preparations of soy/isoflavones administered. Most studies had small sample sizes and were of short duration. The risk of bias was assessed as low in all assessed studies except for one, for which the risk of bias was unclear. Meta-analyses of the two studies including men with identified risk of PCa found a significant reduction in PCa diagnosis after administration of soy/soy isoflavones (risk ratio = 0.49, 95% CI 0.26, 0.95). Meta-analyses indicated no significant differences between groups for prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels or sex steroid endpoints (sex hormone-binding globulin [SHBG], testosterone, free testosterone, oestradiol and dihydrotestosterone). CONCLUSIONS: The results of a meta-analysis of two studies suggest there may be support for epidemiological findings of a potential role for soy/soy isoflavones in PCa risk reduction; however, a clear understanding of the impact of soy/isoflavones on PSA, total testosterone, free testosterone and SHBG levels in men with, or at identified risk of, PCa could not be derived from these data, given the limitations of sample size and study duration in individual trials. A good safety profile is shown by this meta-analysis for soy/soy isoflavones supplementation.	1a
20846650	Hospice care delivered at home, in nursing homes and in dedicated hospice facilities: A systematic review of quantitative and qualitative evidence.	BACKGROUND: Hospice care supports patients and their families physically and emotionally through the dying phase. In many countries a substantial portion of specialised end-of-life care is provided through hospices. Such care has developed outside of general healthcare and is commonly provided in a patient's home or in dedicated facilities. Hospice provision may need to increase in the future due to an ageing population with a greater need for access to end-of-life care. OBJECTIVES: In this systematic review we sought to identify the current evidence on (1) the effectiveness, including cost-effectiveness, of hospices, and hospice care in a patient's home and in nursing homes and (2) the experiences of those who use and of those who provide such services. METHODS: We included quantitative and qualitative studies on hospice care that was provided in a patient's home, nursing home or hospice. We did not include studies on end-of-life care that was provided as part of general healthcare provision, such as by general practitioners in primary care, community nurses or within general hospitals. For quantitative evaluations we included only those that compared hospice care with usual generalist healthcare. The databases CINAHL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and The Cochrane Library were searched from 2003 to 2009. Evidence was assessed for quality and data extractions double-checked. For quantitative studies we present the outcome data comparing hospice versus usual care. For qualitative evaluations we organise findings thematically. FINDINGS: Eighteen comparative evaluations and four thematic papers were identified. Quantitative evidence, mostly of limited quality in design, showed that hospice care at home reduced general health care use and increased family and patient satisfaction with care. Main themes in the qualitative literature revealed that home hospice services support families to sustain patient care at home and hospice day care services generate for the patient a renewed sense of meaning and purpose. CONCLUSIONS: Although studies had methodological limitations, in this review we found much evidence to support the benefits of hospice care. There were limited evaluations found on the impact of hospice care on psychological well-being, such as symptoms of depression, and on inpatient hospice care and non-hospital related costs.	1b
16449995	Quality of life and cost-effectiveness of interferon-alpha in malignant melanoma: results from randomised trial.	A definitive conclusion regarding the value of low-dose extended duration adjuvant interferon-alpha therapy in the treatment of malignant melanoma is only possible once data on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and costs have been considered. This trial randomised 674 patients to interferon alpha-2a (3 megaunits three times per week for 2 years or until recurrence) or placebo. Health-related quality of life (QoL) was to be assessed up to 60 months using the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-C30. Data for the economic analysis, including cost information and the EQ-5D were also collected. Patients in the observation (OBS) group had significantly better mean follow-up quality of on five dimensions of the EORTC QLQ-C30 functional scales: role functioning (P = 0.033), emotional functioning (P = 0.003), cognitive functioning (P = 0.001), social functioning (P = 0.003) and global health status (P = 0.001). Patients in the OBS group had significantly better mean follow-up symptom scores on seven dimensions of the EORTC QLQ-C30 V1 symptom scales. Economic data showed that costs were 3066 pounds higher in the interferon group and produces an incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year of 41,432 pounds at 5 years. The results show that interferon has significant effects on QoL and symptomatology and is unlikely to be cost-effective in this patient group in the UK.	1b
18077217	Cetuximab plus gemcitabine and cisplatin compared with gemcitabine and cisplatin alone in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer: a randomised, multicentre, phase II trial.	BACKGROUND: Preclinical data have suggested a synergistic effect of cetuximab combined with gemcitabine and cisplatin and clinical data have shown a substantial improvement in response and survival when gemcitabine is combined with a platinum analogue compared with gemcitabine alone. The aim of this study was to assess the activity and feasibility of a combination of cetuximab with gemcitabine and cisplatin compared with use of gemcitabine and cisplatin alone for the treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer. METHODS: In a multicentre, randomised phase II trial, 84 patients with advanced pancreatic cancer were randomly assigned to either 250 mg/m2 cetuximab weekly, after a loading dose of 400 mg/m2, plus 1000 mg/m2 gemcitabine and 35 mg/m2 cisplatin on days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle or to the same chemotherapeutic regimen without cetuximab. The primary endpoint was objective response (defined as the proportion of patients whose best response was either partial response or complete response). Secondary endpoints included disease control (defined as the proportion of patients whose best response was either partial response, complete response, or stable disease), progression-free survival, and overall survival. All assessments of response at each site were done blindly by a local experienced radiologist who was not directly involved in the trial. Responses were measured according to an intention-to-treat analysis. This trial is registered with the Clinical Trial registry, number NCT00536614. FINDINGS: 29 men and 13 women were randomly assigned to cetuximab plus gemcitabine and cisplatin (median age 61 years [range 38-78]) and 22 men and 20 women were randomly assigned to gemcitabine and cisplatin (median age 64 years [range 40-76]). Seven of 40 (17.5%) patients had an objective response in the cetuximab group (95% CI 7.3-32.8) and five of 41 (12.2%) patients had an objective response in the non-cetuximab group (95% CI 4.1-26.2). No significant difference was noted between the groups both for objective response (5.3% higher in the cetuximab group [95% CI -16.5 to 27.1]; chi2 test=0.360; p=0.549) or for disease control (3.5% higher in the non-cetuximab group [-34.0% to 27.0%]; 0.446; p=0.504). Overall median follow-up was 11.8 months (range 2.5-18.5). No significant differences between the groups were noted in median progression-free survival (hazard ratio 0.96, 95% CI 0.60-1.52, p=0.847) or in median overall survival (0.91, 0.54-1.55, p=0.739): median progression-free survival was 3.4 months (95% CI 2.4-5.1) in the cetuximab group and 4.2 months (2.6-5.4) in the non-cetuximab group; median overall survival was 7.5 months (5.1-8.8) and 7.8 months (5.3-15.0), respectively. 33 patients from both groups had at least one grade 3-4 toxic effect. INTERPRETATION: The addition of cetuximab to a combination of gemcitabine and cisplatin does not increase response or survival for patients with advanced pancreatic cancer. Although toxic effects were not increased by cetuximab, this combination should not be further assessed in phase III trials.	1b
24114053	Intensity of follow-up after melanoma surgery.	This contemporary review of melanoma surveillance strategies seeks to help practitioners examine and improve their surveillance protocols based on the currently available data. In general, there is no definitive benefit from increased screening or more aggressive use of interval imaging. Low-intensity surveillance strategies do not appear to adversely affect patient outcomes and should be the preferred approach compared with high-intensity strategies for most melanoma patients. All surveillance programs should emphasize education in order to maximize the effectiveness of patient-based detection of recurrent disease.	4
26790922	Wide versus narrow excision margins for high-risk, primary cutaneous melanomas: long-term follow-up of survival in a randomised trial.	BACKGROUND: The necessary margin of excision for cutaneous melanomas greater than 2 mm in thickness is controversial. At a median follow-up of 5 years, findings from our previously published randomised trial of narrow (1 cm) versus wide (3 cm) excision margins in patients with thick cutaneous melanomas showed that narrow margins were associated with an increased frequency of locoregional relapse, but no significant difference in overall survival was apparent. We now report a long-term survival analysis of that trial. METHODS: We did a randomised, open-label multicentre trial in 59 hospitals--57 in the UK, one in Poland, and one in South Africa. Patients with one primary localised cutaneous melanoma greater than 2 mm in Breslow thickness on the trunk or limbs (excluding palms or soles) were randomly assigned (1:1) centrally to receive surgery with either a 1 cm or 3 cm excision margin following an initial surgery. The randomisation lists were generated with random permuted blocks and stratified by centre and extent of initial surgery. The endpoints of this analysis were overall survival and melanoma-specific survival. Analyses were done in the intention-to-treat population. This trial was not registered because it predated mandatory trial registration. FINDINGS: Between Dec 16, 1992, and May 22, 2001, we randomly assigned 900 patients to surgery with either a 1 cm excision margin (n=453) or a 3 cm excision margin (n=447). At a median follow-up of 8.8 years (106 months [IQR 76-135], 494 patients had died, with 359 of these deaths attributed to melanoma. 194 deaths were attributed to melanoma in the 1 cm group compared with 165 in the 3 cm group (unadjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1.24 [95% CI 1.01-1.53]; p=0.041). Although a higher number of deaths overall occurred in the 1 cm group compared with the 3 cm group (253 vs 241), the difference was not significant (unadjusted HR 1.14 [95% CI 0.96-1.36]; p=0.14). Surgical complications were reported in 35 (8%) patients in the 1 cm excision margin group and 65 (15%) patients in the 3 cm group. INTERPRETATION: Our findings suggest that a 1 cm excision margin is inadequate for cutaneous melanoma with Breslow thickness greater than 2 mm on the trunk and limbs. Current guidelines advise a 2 cm margin for melanomas greater than 2 mm in thickness but only a 1 cm margin for thinner melanomas. The adequacy of a 1 cm margin for thinner melanomas with poor prognostic features should be addressed in future randomised studies.

20376442	Prognostic impact of para-aortic lymph node metastasis in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.	BACKGROUND: The aim of the present study was to clarify the prognostic impact of para-aortic lymph node metastasis in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. METHODS: Medical records of 103 consecutive patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, who underwent pancreatic resection with regional and para-aortic lymph node dissection were reviewed retrospectively. Clinicopathological factors and survival were compared between patients with and without para-aortic lymph node metastasis. RESULTS: Tumor size (p = 0.045), extrapancreatic nerve plexus invasion (p = 0.043), UICC pT factor (p = 0.026), and surgical margin status (p = 0.002) were associated significantly with para-aortic lymph node metastasis. Postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy (p < 0.001) and absence of extrapancreatic nerve plexus invasion (p = 0.041) were associated independently with longer survival, but para-aortic lymph node metastasis (p = 0.078) was not associated significantly with survival by multivariate analysis. The 2- and 5-year survival rates and median survival time of patients with and without para-aortic lymph node metastasis were 12, 0%, 12.4 months and 49, 23%, 14.5 months, respectively, and there was a significant difference in survival between the two groups by a log-rank test (p < 0.001). Postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy significantly improved the survival of patients with para-aortic lymph node metastasis (p = 0.025). CONCLUSIONS: The prognosis of patients with para-aortic lymph node metastasis is poor in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. However, postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy may improve survival.	2b
27374946	Can skin cancer prevention be improved through mobile technology interventions? A systematic review.	OBJECTIVE: Print-based health promotion interventions are being phased out to bring forth more appealing and assessable new technology applications. This review aimed to evaluate the current literature on the use of mobile text messaging and similar electronic technology interventions in the area of skin cancer prevention. METHOD: A search of studies guided by Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) was conducted on mobile technology interventions for improving skin cancer prevention in the electronic databases PubMed, MEDLINE, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), and PsycINFO. RESULTS: Overall, 136 articles were screened for eligibility between 2001 (earliest relevant article found) and November 2015. Eight studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were reviewed according to the PRISMA guidelines. Of these, five were randomised controlled trials (RCTs), two were controlled clinical trials, and one was a cohort study. Five studies used text messages as an intervention, two used mobile phone applications, and another used electronic messages via email. All studies resulted in self-reported behaviour change in at least one of their outcome measures (e.g., sunscreen application, seeking shade). CONCLUSION: While the behaviour change outcomes are promising, the lack of change in more objective measures such as sunburn indicates a need to further improve mobile phone technology-delivered interventions in order to have a greater impact on skin cancer prevention. Future studies may consider the use of objective outcome measures (e.g., sunscreen weight), electronic diaries, or behavioural outcomes in social networks.	1a
16467544	Radiotherapy plus cetuximab for squamous-cell carcinoma of the head and neck.	BACKGROUND: We conducted a multinational, randomized study to compare radiotherapy alone with radiotherapy plus cetuximab, a monoclonal antibody against the epidermal growth factor receptor, in the treatment of locoregionally advanced squamous-cell carcinoma of the head and neck. METHODS: Patients with locoregionally advanced head and neck cancer were randomly assigned to treatment with high-dose radiotherapy alone (213 patients) or high-dose radiotherapy plus weekly cetuximab (211 patients) at an initial dose of 400 mg per square meter of body-surface area, followed by 250 mg per square meter weekly for the duration of radiotherapy. The primary end point was the duration of control of locoregional disease; secondary end points were overall survival, progression-free survival, the response rate, and safety. RESULTS: The median duration of locoregional control was 24.4 months among patients treated with cetuximab plus radiotherapy and 14.9 months among those given radiotherapy alone (hazard ratio for locoregional progression or death, 0.68; P=0.005). With a median follow-up of 54.0 months, the median duration of overall survival was 49.0 months among patients treated with combined therapy and 29.3 months among those treated with radiotherapy alone (hazard ratio for death, 0.74; P=0.03). Radiotherapy plus cetuximab significantly prolonged progression-free survival (hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.70; P=0.006). With the exception of acneiform rash and infusion reactions, the incidence of grade 3 or greater toxic effects, including mucositis, did not differ significantly between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of locoregionally advanced head and neck cancer with concomitant high-dose radiotherapy plus cetuximab improves locoregional control and reduces mortality without increasing the common toxic effects associated with radiotherapy to the head and neck.

15812554	Meta-analysis of randomised adjuvant therapy trials for pancreatic cancer.	The aim of this study was to investigate the worldwide evidence of the roles of adjuvant chemoradiation and adjuvant chemotherapy on survival in potentially curative resected pancreatic cancer. Five randomised controlled trials of adjuvant treatment in patients with histologically proven pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma were identified, of which the four most recent trials provided individual patient data (875 patients). This meta-analysis includes previously unpublished follow-up data on 261 patients. The pooled estimate of the hazard ratio (HR) indicated a 25% significant reduction in the risk of death with chemotherapy (H = 0.75, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.64, 0.90, P-values(stratified) (Pstrat) = 0.001) with median survival estimated at 19.0 (95% CI: 16.4, 21.1) months with chemotherapy and 13.5 (95% CI: 12.2, 15.8) without. The 2- and 5-year survival rates were estimated at 38 and 19%, respectively, with chemotherapy and 28 and 12% without. The pooled estimate of the HR indicated no significant difference in the risk of death with chemoradiation (HR = 1.09, 95% CI: 0.89, 1.32, Pstrat = 0.43) with median survivals estimated at 15.8 (95% CI: 13.9, 18.1) months with chemoradiation and 15.2 (95% CI: 13.1, 18.2) without. The 2- and 5-year survival rates were estimated at 30 and 12%, respectively, with chemoradiation and 34 and 17% without. Subgroup analyses estimated that chemoradiation was more effective and chemotherapy less effective in patients with positive resection margins. These results show that chemotherapy is effective adjuvant treatment in pancreatic cancer but not chemoradiation. Further studies with chemoradiation are warranted in patients with positive resection margins, as chemotherapy appeared relatively ineffective in this patient subgroup.	1a
18342200	Ten-year biochemical disease control for patients with prostate cancer treated with cryosurgery as primary therapy.	OBJECTIVES: Prostate cryosurgery has been increasingly used for the management of localized prostate cancer since its introduction in a minimally invasive form in the early 1990s. We performed a retrospective study of the largest and most mature patient group treated with cryosurgery reported thus far. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the data from 370 patients treated consecutively from 1991 to 1996 with a focus on the determination of biochemical disease-free survival for a group of patients with T1 to T3 prostate cancer who had undergone prostate cryosurgery as primary monotherapy. Only patients with no previous radiotherapy, hormonal therapy, or surgery were included. RESULTS: The median follow-up was 12.55 years. Using a nadir plus 2 ng/dL definition, Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated a biochemical disease-free survival rate at 10 years of 80.56%, 74.16%, and 45.54% for low, moderate, and high-risk groups, respectively. The 10-year negative biopsy rate was 76.96%. CONCLUSIONS: The results for this pilot group of patients who underwent percutaneous prostate cryosurgery monotherapy demonstrated biochemical disease-free survival rates that overlap with those of similar groups of patients treated under similar circumstances using other types of nonextirpative monotherapy.	3a
21383281	Lymphatic mapping and sentinel lymph node biopsy in patients with melanoma: a meta-analysis.	PURPOSE: To perform a meta-analysis of all published studies of sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy for staging patients with melanoma. METHODS: Published literature in all languages between 1990 and 2009 was critically appraised. Primary outcomes evaluated included the proportion successfully mapped (PSM) and test performance including false-negative rate (FNR), post-test probability negative (PTPN), and positive predictive value in the same nodal basin recurrence. RESULTS: A total of 71 studies including 25,240 patients met full eligibility criteria. The average PSM was 98.1% (95% CI, 97.3% to 98.6%) and increased with the year of publication, female sex, ulceration, age, and the quality score of the studies. The FNR ranged from 0.0% to 34.0%, averaging 12.5% overall (95% CI, 11% to 14.2%). FNR increased with the length of follow-up (P = .002) but decreased with greater PSM (P = .001). PTPN averaged 3.4% (95% CI, 3.0% to 3.8%), which also increased in studies with longer follow-up, younger age, female sex, deeper Breslow thickness, and with tumor ulceration while decreasing with greater PSM (P < .001). Approximately 20% of the patients with a positive SLN had additional lymph nodes in the complete lymph node dissection and 7.5% of the patients with positive SLN developed recurrence in the same nodal basin which was greater in studies that also reported higher FNR (P = .01). CONCLUSION: The estimated risk of nodal recurrence after a negative SLN biopsy was </= 5% supporting the use of this technology for staging patients with melanoma.	1a
21708855	Is oral methadone better than placebo or other oral/transdermal opioids in the management of pain?	AIM: To address the question: is oral methadone better than placebo, or other oral/transdermal opioids in the management of cancer pain? METHOD: A literature search was performed to identify relevant studies. Search strategies included: (1) methadone (title) AND placebo (title or abstract) AND pain (title or abstract); (2) methadone (title) AND randomized (title or abstract) AND pain (title or abstract) AND cancer (title or abstract). Papers were reviewed for relevance to first-line opioid therapy. RESULTS: No studies were identified comparing methadone to placebo for cancer pain. A single study compared methadone to placebo for neuropathic pain and demonstrated evidence of analgesic effect at a dose of 20 mg/day but not at a dose of 10 mg/day. Four studies compared oral methadone to either oral morphine, or oral morphine and transdermal fentanyl in a first-line setting: Gourlay 1986 (N = 18), Ventafridda 1986 (N =54), Bruera 2004 (N = 106) and Mercadante 2008 (N = 108). All studies demonstrated comparable, but not superior, analgesia with, overall, a comparable adverse effect profile. The duration of the study period for the three largest studies was 28 days. Two of these studies, Ventafridda 1986 and Mercadante 2008, indicated that, over time, the opioid escalation index was lower for methadone than for morphine. One study that used a 2:1 dose ratio between morphine and methadone was associated with a high attrition rate in the first week because of excessive sedation. This effect was not seen in the study that used a 4:1 morphine to methadone dose ratio with dose titration. CONCLUSION: This limited data suggests that (1) methadone may be an equally effective candidate for first-line opioid therapy, (2) that it is possibly less expensive, (3) that there may be a propensity to sedation and dose accumulation unless there is close monitoring and conservative dose selection and (4) that it should be initiated with a calculated dose based on a morphine to methadone dose ratio of not less than 4:1.	1b
8790168	Surgical resection for melanoma metastatic to the gastrointestinal tract.	OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the role of surgery in the survival of patients with melanoma metastatic to the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. DESIGN: Retrospective review. SETTING: Tertiary cancer center. PATIENTS: One hundred twenty-four potential surgical candidates with metastatic melanoma in the stomach, small intestine, colon, or rectum. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Operative morbidity and mortality, relief of presenting symptoms, and median and 5-year survival. RESULTS: The median disease-free interval prior to diagnosis of GI tract metastasis was 23.2 months (range, 1-154 months). Patients typically presented with crampy abdominal pain, symptomatic mass, and/or occult GI tract blood loss. Of the 124 patients, 69(55%) underwent surgical exploration of the abdomen, 46 (66%) had curative resection, and 23 (34%) had a palliative procedure. There was only 1 operative death and 1 major operative complication; 67 (97%) of 69 surgical patients experienced postoperative relief of their presenting GI tract symptoms. The median survival in patients undergoing curative resection was 48.9 months, compared with only 5.4 months and 5.7 months in those undergoing palliative procedures and nonsurgical interventions, respectively. By multivariate analysis, the 2 most important prognostic factors for long-term survival were complete resection of GI tract metastases and the GI tract as the initial site of distant metastases. CONCLUSIONS: Almost all patients with melanoma and GI tract metastases can have palliation of symptoms by surgical intervention with minimal morbidity and mortality. The high 5-year survival rate associated with complete surgical resection of GI tract metastases indicates that surgery should be strongly considered for this subgroup of patients with melanoma and distant metastatic disease.	2b
30083701	Association of Endometrial Cancer Risk With Postmenopausal Bleeding in Women: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.	Importance: As the worldwide burden of endometrial cancer continues to rise, interest is growing in the evaluation of early detection and prevention strategies among women at increased risk. Focusing efforts on women with postmenopausal bleeding (PMB), a common symptom of endometrial cancer, may be a useful strategy; however, PMB is not specific for endometrial cancer and is often caused by benign conditions. Objective: To provide a reference of the prevalence of PMB in endometrial cancers and the risk of endometrial cancer in women with PMB. Data Sources: For this systematic review and meta-analysis, PubMed and Embase were searched for English-language studies published January 1, 1977, through January 31, 2017. Study Selection: Observational studies reporting the prevalence of PMB in women with endometrial cancer and the risk of endometrial cancer in women with PMB in unselected populations were selected. Data Extraction and Synthesis: Two independent reviewers evaluated study quality and risk of bias using items from the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale and the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies tool. Studies that included highly selected populations, lacked detailed inclusion criteria, and/or included 25 or fewer women were excluded. Main Outcomes and Measures: The pooled prevalence of PMB in women with endometrial cancer and the risk of endometrial cancer in women with PMB. Results: A total of 129 unique studies, including 34432 unique patients with PMB and 6358 with endometrial cancer (40790 women), were analyzed. The pooled prevalence of PMB among women with endometrial cancer was 91% (95% CI, 87%-93%), irrespective of tumor stage. The pooled risk of endometrial cancer among women with PMB was 9% (95% CI, 8%-11%), with estimates varying by use of hormone therapy (range, 7% [95% CI, 6%-9%] to 12% [95% CI, 9%-15%]; P < .001 for heterogeneity) and geographic region (range, 5% [95% CI, 3%-11%] in North America to 13% [95% CI, 9%-19%] in Western Europe; P = .09 for heterogeneity). Conclusions and Relevance: Early detection strategies focused on women with PMB have the potential to capture as many as 90% of endometrial cancers; however, most women with PMB will not be diagnosed with endometrial cancer. These results can aid in the assessment of the potential clinical value of new early detection markers and clinical management strategies for endometrial cancer and will help to inform clinical and epidemiologic risk prediction models to support decision making.	2a
19004572	Sooner or later? Outcome analysis of 431 prostate cancer patients treated with postoperative or salvage radiotherapy.	PURPOSE: To evaluate the outcome of postoperative radiotherapy (PORT) and salvage RT (SART) using a three-dimensional conformal two-dynamic arc (3D-ART) or 3D six-field technique in 431 prostate cancer patients. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Of the 431 patients, 258 underwent PORT (started <6 months after radical prostatectomy) and 173 underwent SART because of biochemical failure after radical prostatectomy. The median patient age, preoperative prostate-specific antigen level, and Gleason score was 66 years, 9.4 ng/mL, and 7, respectively. The median radiation dose was 70 Gy in 35 fractions for both PORT and SART. The 3D six-field and 3D-ART techniques were used in 25.1% and 74.9% of patients, respectively. Biochemical failure was defined as a post-RT prostate-specific antigen nadir plus 0.1 ng/mL. RESULTS: Acute toxicity included rectal events (PORT, 44.2% and 0.8% Grade 1-2 and Grade 3, respectively; SART, 42.2% and 1.2% Grade 1-2 and Grade 3, respectively) and urinary events (PORT, 51.2% and 2.3% Grade 1-2 and Grade 3-4, respectively; SART, 37.6% and 0% Grade 1-2 and Grade 3, respectively). Late toxicity also included rectal events (PORT, 14.7% and 0.8% Grade 1-2 and Grade 3-4, respectively; SART, 15.0% and 0.6% Grade 1-2 and Grade 3, respectively) and urinary events (PORT, 28.3% and 3.7% Grade 1-2 and Grade 3-4, respectively; SART, 19.3% and 0.6% Grade 1-2 and Grade 3, respectively). After a median follow-up of 48 months, failure-free survival, including biochemical and clinical failure, was significantly longer in the PORT patients (79.8% vs. 60.5%, p < 0.0001). Multivariate analysis showed that a prostate-specific antigen level postoperatively but before RT of >/=0.2 ng/mL (p < 0.001), Gleason score >6 (p = 0.025) and use of preoperative androgen deprivation (p = 0.002) correlated significantly with shorter failure-free survival. Multivariate analysis showed that PORT and the 3D-ART technique correlated with greater late urinary toxicity. CONCLUSION: PORT and early referral for SART offer better disease control after radical prostatectomy. The greater urinary toxicity occurring after PORT and 3D-ART requires further investigation to improve the therapeutic index.	2a
21684027	Meta-analysis of chemotherapy in head and neck cancer (MACH-NC): a comprehensive analysis by tumour site.	INTRODUCTION: The recently updated meta-analysis of chemotherapy in head and neck cancer (MACH-NC) demonstrated the benefit of the addition of chemotherapy in terms of overall survival in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). The magnitude of the benefit according to tumour site is unknown as well as their potential interactions with patient or trial characteristics. METHODS: Eighty seven randomized trials performed between 1965 and 2000 were included in the present analysis. Patients were divided into four categories according to tumour location: oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx and larynx. Patients with other tumour location were excluded (999, 5.7%). For each tumour location and chemotherapy timing, the logrank-test, stratified by trial, was used to compare treatments. The hazard ratios of death or relapse were calculated. Interactions between patient or trial characteristics and chemotherapy effect were studied. RESULTS: Individual patient data of 16,192 patients were analysed, with a median follow-up of 5.6years. The benefit of the addition is consistent in all tumour locations, with hazard ratios between 0.87 and 0.88 (p-value of interaction=0.99). Chemotherapy benefit was higher for concomitant administration for all tumour locations, but the interaction test between chemotherapy timing and treatment effect was only significant for oropharyngeal (p<0.0001) and laryngeal tumours (p=0.05), and not for oral cavity (p=0.15) and hypopharyngeal tumours (p=0.30). The 5-year absolute benefits associated with the concomitant chemotherapy are 8.9%, 8.1%, 5.4% and 4% for oral cavity, oropharynx, larynx and hypopharynx tumours, respectively. CONCLUSION: The benefit of the addition of chemotherapy to locoregional treatment is consistent in all tumour locations of HNSCC. The higher benefit of concomitant schedule was demonstrated only for oropharyngeal and laryngeal tumours but this may be only a consequence of a lack of power.	1a
16170164	Risk-adapted androgen deprivation and escalated three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy for prostate cancer: Does radiation dose influence outcome of patients treated with adjuvant androgen deprivation? A GICOR study.	PURPOSE: Multicenter study conducted to determine the impact on biochemical control and survival of risk-adapted androgen deprivation (AD) combined with high-dose three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3DCRT) for prostate cancer. Results of biochemical control are reported. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between October 1999 and October 2001, 416 eligible patients with prostate cancer were assigned to one of three treatment groups according to their risk factors: 181 low-risk patients were treated with 3DCRT alone; 75 intermediate-risk patients were allocated to receive neoadjuvant AD (NAD) 4-6 months before and during 3DCRT; and 160 high-risk patients received NAD and adjuvant AD (AAD) 2 years after 3DCRT. Stratification was performed for treatment/risk group and total radiation dose. RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 36 months (range, 18 to 63 months), the actuarial biochemical disease-free survival (bDFS) at 5 years for all patients was 74%. The corresponding figures for low-risk, intermediate-risk, and high-risk disease were 80%, 73%, and 79%, respectively (P = .847). Univariate analysis showed that higher radiation dose was the only significant factor associated with bDFS for all patients (P = .0004). When stratified for treatment group, this benefit was evident for low-risk patients (P = .009) and, more interestingly, for high-risk patients treated with AAD. The 5-year bDFS for high-risk patients treated with AAD was 63% for radiation doses less than 72 Gy and 84% for those > or = 72 Gy (P = .003). CONCLUSION: The results of combined AAD plus high-dose 3DCRT are encouraging. To our knowledge, this is the first study showing an additional benefit of high-dose 3DCRT when combined with long-term AD for unfavorable disease.	2a
12181242	Whole-body hyperthermia (41.8 degrees C) combined with bimonthly oxaliplatin, high-dose leucovorin and 5-fluorouracil 48-hour continuous infusion in pretreated metastatic colorectal cancer: a phase II study.	BACKGROUND: Second- and third-line treatments remain a challenge in advanced colorectal cancer. Studies of bimonthly regimens of high-dose leucovorin (LV) and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) by continuous infusion combined with oxaliplatin (L-OHP) have shown encouraging response rates in patients not responding to a bimonthly LV/5-FU regimen. Hyperthermic enhancement of L-OHP efficiency by increased DNA adduct formation has been demonstrated in vitro. This study was designed to address feasibility, toxicity and efficacy issues of whole-body hyperthermia (WBH) as an adjunct to L-OHP/LV/5-FU in pretreated patients after progression to first- and second-line treatments with LV/5-FU by continuous infusion and irinotecan. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty-four patients with advanced colorectal cancer, who had progressed during or within 3 months after completion of chemotherapy with LV/5-FU 24-h infusion (LV/5-FU(24h)) (eight patients) or irinotecan combined with or after LV/5-FU(24h )(36 patients), were treated with L-OHP 85 mg/m(2), 2-h intravenous (i.v.) infusion, followed by LV 200 mg/m(2), 1-h i.v. infusion, and 5-FU 3 g/m(2), 48-h continuous infusion. Every second cycle of the biweekly regimen was combined with WBH, thus allowing a comparison of toxicity with and without WBH in the same patient. Whole-body hyperthermia was administered by a humidified radiant heat device. The target temperature of 41.8 degrees C was maintained for 60 min. L-OHP (2-h infusion) was started at a core body temperature of 39 degrees C. RESULTS: All patients could be evaluated for toxicity, and 41 patients were evaluable for response. A total of 273 L-OHP-containing regimens were administered, 130 with and 143 without WBH. Hyperthermic treatment combined with L-OHP/LV/5-FU showed no unexpected toxicities. WHO grade 3 toxicities were rare and evenly balanced between cycles given with or without WBH. One early death occurred due to sepsis and tumor lysis. The overall response rate was 20%, with two complete and six partial responses. Twenty-three patients (56%) had stable disease and nine patients (22%) progressive disease. With a median observation time of 70 weeks, the median time to progression was 21 weeks [95% confidence interval (CI) 17-25 weeks] and the median survival was 50 weeks (95% CI 39-61 weeks) from the start of therapy. CONCLUSIONS: This trial suggests some advantage of combining L-OHP/LV/5-FU with WBH. Results compare favorably with the activity of similar regimens without WBH in less extensively pretreated patients. These data support further evaluation and warrant phase III studies.	2b
28577885	Isolated tumor cells identified by sentinel lymph node mapping in endometrial cancer: Does adjuvant treatment matter?	OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the outcome and the role of adjuvant treatment in the management of patients with endometrial cancer and isolated tumor cells (ITCs) identified by SLN mapping. METHODS: This single center study identified all patients undergoing hysterectomy, salpingo-oophorectomy, lymphadenectomy and SLN mapping for endometrial cancer between November 2010 and December 2015. Data was prospectively collected. Progression-free survival was analyzed according to the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using the log-rank test. RESULTS: A total of 519 patients were included. Overall, 85 patients (16.4%) were found to have SLN metastases of which 43 (51%) were macrometastasis, 11 (13%) micrometastasis (MM) and 31 (36%) ITC. Eleven (35%) of patients with ITCs received adjuvant chemotherapy+/-whole pelvic radiation therapy (WPRT), 10 (32%) received WPRT, and 10 (32%) received either no adjuvant treatment or vault brachytherapy (VBT) only. ITC patients received significantly less chemotherapy (p=0.0001) and WPRT (p=0.007) compared to patients with macrometastasis. Of note, ITC were not considered node positive in our study. With a median follow-up of 29months (range: 0-67), the progression free survival (PFS) at 3-years for the ITC patients was 95.5%, similar to node negative (87.6%) and micrometastasis patients (85.5%), but statistically better than patients with macrometastasis (58.5%) (p=0.0012). Only 1/31 patient with ITC recurred (IB, 7cm carcinosarcoma) despite adjuvant treatments. None of the ITC patients with endometrioid histology recurred (0/28) and none of the ITC patients who did not receive adjuvant treatment or VBT recurred (0/10). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with endometrial cancer found to have SLN ITCs have an excellent outcome. The use of adjuvant treatment should be tailored to uterine factors and histology and not solely based on the presence of ITCs. Patients with ITCs and otherwise low-risk uterine disease probably derive little benefit from receiving additional treatments. More studies are needed to confirm our results.	3a
15988645	Prostate cancer and sexually transmitted diseases: a meta-analysis.	BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer is the most common neoplasm of American men and the second most common cause of cancer-related deaths. Research suggests that infection and subsequent inflammation may be an important risk factor in the pathogenesis of prostate cancer. In this meta-analysis, we examine the current epidemiological evidence for the association between specific sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and prostate cancer. METHODS: Using an English language search of Medline and CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health) since 1966, 29 case-control studies were identified. These studies included a total of 6,022 cases of prostate cancer and 7,320 controls. Using Review Manager, combined odds ratios (ORs) were calculated for any STDs, gonorrhea, syphilis, and human papillomavirus (HPV) for prostate cancer. RESULTS: Significant elevated ORs for prostate cancer were demonstrated for any STDs (1.48, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.26-1.73), gonorrhea (1.35, 95% CI 1.05-1.83), and human papillomavirus (1.39, 95% CI 1.12-2.06). CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis provides evidence of a higher rate of prostate cancer in men with a history of an exposure to gonorrhea, HPV, or any STD. Further research, especially with cohort studies, is required to confirm this potentially modifiable risk factor.	2a
26983408	Safety of vemurafenib in patients with BRAF (V600) mutated metastatic melanoma: the Spanish experience.	OBJECTIVES: Vemurafenib tolerability was assessed in a large, open-label, multicentre study in patients with BRAF (V600) mutated advanced melanoma. We investigated safety, tolerability and efficacy of vemurafenib in Spanish patients participating in that study. METHODS: Patients with previously treated or treatment-naive, unresectable stage IIIC or stage IV, BRAF (V600) mutation-positive melanoma received vemurafenib 960 mg twice daily until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent or death. The primary endpoint was safety; secondary endpoints included overall response rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: 301 Spanish patients were included, 70 % with M1c disease, 22 % with brain metastases and 51 % with prior systemic therapy for metastatic disease. Most frequent adverse events included fatigue (48 %), arthralgia (45 %), rash (41 %), photosensitivity (34 %) and skin neoplasms (21 %). Grade 3/4 adverse events occurred in 156 patients (52 %), including cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (including keratoacanthoma; 16 %), fatigue (6 %) and arthralgia (5 %). The ORR was 28 % (95 % CI 23-34 %). Responses occurred in patients with brain metastases (18 %), elevated baseline lactate dehydrogenase (19 %) and poor performance status (15 %), and elderly patients (22 %). Median PFS was 5.8 (95 % CI 5.0-6.4) months; median OS was 10.5 (95 % CI 9.5-13.5) months. CONCLUSION: Our results for Spanish patients in the vemurafenib safety study indicate similar efficacy and a comparable safety profile in Spanish patients with no new safety signals compared with the overall population. Clinical benefit was demonstrated in poor-prognosis patients and in those with favourable baseline characteristics, suggesting that poor-prognosis patients may also benefit from vemurafenib treatment.	3a
872133	Evaluation of extended-field radiotherapy for prostatic neoplasm: 1976 progress report.	These observations show that short-term, disease-free survival is (a) excellent (86.5%) in patients with negative lymph node biopsies, (b) greatly diminished (30%) in patients with positive para-aortic and pelvic lymph node biopsies, and (c) intermediate (71.5%) in patients with positive pelvic lymph node biopsies only in the pelvic region following extended-field radiation therapy of carcinoma of the prostate.	2b
22076216	Prospective evaluation of supportive care with or without CVD chemotherapy as a second-line treatment in advanced melanoma by patient's choice: a multicentre Dermatologic Cooperative Oncology Group trial.	This prospective, nonrandomized multicentre, phase III study compared best supportive care (BSC) alone with cisplatin, vindesine and dacabazine-based (CVD) chemotherapy and BSC in patients with advanced melanoma. A total of 117 pretreated patients with metastatic melanoma were evaluated, 34 patients in arm A (BSC) and 83 in arm B (BSC and CVD). Primary endpoint was overall survival and secondary endpoints were disease control rate and quality of life (European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer QLQ-C30). Owing to sparse recruitment of patients for randomization, the protocol has been changed based on patients' choice. Baseline characteristics were imbalanced with respect to the Karnofsky Performance Index (P=0.001), the existence of brain metastases (P=0.035) and earlier application of chemoimmunotherapy (P=0.038). Disease control was observed in 8.8% of patients in arm A and in 28.9% of patients in arm B (P=0.028). Median overall survival time was 137 days in arm A and 229 days in arm B (P=0.014). Multivariate analyses could not ascribe this prognostic benefit to CVD treatment. No significant difference in the quality of life could be found. This study could not detect clear survival benefits for polychemotherapy with CVD compared with BSC alone in patients with advanced metastatic melanoma. Interestingly, having the choice of chemotherapy or BSC alone in a second-line situation, more than 70% of patients chose polychemotherapy.	2b
15234035	Prognostic impact of tumor volumetry in patients with locally advanced head-and-neck carcinoma (non-nasopharyngeal) treated by radiotherapy alone or combined radiochemotherapy in a randomized trial.	PURPOSE: Tumor volume (TV) is one of the main reported factors determining the outcome of treatment in head-and-neck carcinomas. In this study, the prognostic impact of TV was explored in the context of a randomized trial with the patients assigned to receive standard radiotherapy (RT) alone or RT plus platinum compounds (RT alone, RT plus cisplatin, or RT plus carboplatin). METHODS AND MATERIALS: The tumor outlines were traced and digitized on each pretreatment CT slice for each of the 101 patients studied. Taking into account the magnification factor of the scan and CT slice thickness, a computer with specifically designed software calculated the TV in cubic centimeters. RESULTS: The median overall survival for the whole group of patients was 21.6 months (95% confidence interval, 13.0-30.2) and the 3-year survival rate was 40%. The addition of platinum compounds to RT (Groups 2 and 3) significantly improved the survival rate (RT alone vs. RT plus cisplatin, hazard ratio 0.36, p = 0.002; RT alone vs. RT plus carboplatin, hazard ratio 0.53, p = 0.029). In univariate analysis, the most significant parameters for survival were treatment group, total gross tumor volume (TGTV), complete response, nodal GTV, primary GTV, and performance status. In multivariate analysis, treatment group, TGTV, gender, and primary site were independent prognostic factors for survival. A prognostic threshold of 22.8 cm(3) was detected for TGTV. Patients with a TGTV of <22.8 cm(3) were more likely to achieve a complete response and had a median survival of 45.3 months, and those with a TGTV >22.8 cm(3) had a median survival of 12.3 months (log-rank test, p = 0.0102). CONCLUSION: The prognostic significance of the TGTV was confirmed and a cutoff value of 22.8 cm(3) derived. Our data indicated that locally advanced head-and-neck carcinomas should not be treated by standard (once-daily) RT alone. Tumor size and disease subsite should be taken into account in future randomized trials to increase their statistical power.	2b
2492898	Histologic tumor regression grades in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck after preoperative radiochemotherapy.	Forty-one patients with Stage III and IV squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) of the head and neck were treated preoperatively with mitomycin C and 5-fluorouracil and concomitant radiotherapy. Operation specimen were examined histologically, the percentage of vital tumor cells and devitalized tumor cells were graduated. The grade of regression was classified according to a four-stage scale. Tumor regression was elevated as good (Grades 1, 2) and bad (3, 4) response to combined preoperative therapy. After a follow-up of 18 to 30 months, 14 of 41 patients have experienced a locoregional recurrence; all these patients were bad responders (Grades 3, 4) to preoperative radiochemotherapy. There was a statistically significant correlation between tumor regression grade and probability of survival (P less than 0.001). The authors conclude that the prognosis of patients with pretreated SCC of head and neck depends on the histologic grade of tumor regression.	4
17968629	Portal vein resection in surgery for cancer of biliary tract and pancreas: special reference to the relationship between the surgical outcome and site of primary tumor.	BACKGROUND: Early and late outcomes after superior mesenteric-portal vein resection (VR) combined with pancreaticoduodenectomy, major hepatectomy, or both for pancreaticobiliary carcinoma were retrospectively evaluated. VR is the most frequently used vascular procedure in this field, but an exact role of VR has not been compared according to the primary site of tumor. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Postoperative outcomes were compared between surgery with and without VR in each of the three disease-based groups: hilar cholangiocarcinoma and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma with hilar extension (HIC, 56), middle and distal cholangiocarcinoma and gallbladder carcinoma (DGC, 118), and pancreatic head adenocarcinoma (PHC, 77). RESULTS: VR was performed in 19.6% of HIC, 8.5% of DGC, and 45.5% of PHC. In-hospital death was 7.1% (4 of 56) patients with VR (3 of DGC and 1 of PHC). Operations with VR in DGC showed a larger amount of blood loss and more increased ratio of R1operation than those with no VR. In HIC, DGC, and PHC, median survival time of patients with VR was 37, 6.8, and 20 months and that of patients without VR was 42.9, 28.6, and 20.3 months, respectively. VR did not affect survival either in HIC or in PHC; however, in DGC, VR was accompanied with dismal outcome compared with no VR (p=0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Aggressive surgery with VR can be justified both in HIC and in PHC but should not be recommended for DGC. Surgical outcomes of VR differed considerably, depending on the sites of the primary tumor.	2b
24989125	Operative management of metastatic melanoma in bone may require en bloc resection of disease.	BACKGROUND: Bone metastasis is a poor prognostic indicator in melanoma. Some authors have advocated only palliative treatment for patients with osseous disease. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We determined (1) overall survival after surgery for bone metastasis in patients with malignant melanoma, (2) the rate of local relapse after surgery for bone metastasis, (3) whether certain patients might benefit from more extensive surgery to reduce the risk of local recurrence, and (4) whether there is an effect of prior radiation on survival and local progression. METHODS: We identified 37 patients who underwent 41 orthopaedic procedures for metastatic melanoma to bone in the pelvis or appendicular skeleton, including 20 for pathologic fracture, from our institutional orthopaedic database and performed a retrospective review of their charts and radiographs. The femur (n = 19) and humerus (n = 11) were the most common operative sites. Kaplan-Meier survivorship was used to determine overall survival and local progression-free survival. RESULTS: The median survival from surgery was 9 months (range, 1-135 months). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed overall survival of 30% at 12 months and 17% at 24 months. Local recurrence developed in seven of 41 lesions (17%). The local progression-free survival was 87% at 12 months and 67% at 24 months. Patients for whom prior radiation failed and patients who did not have excision of osseous metastases had higher rates of local recurrence. Two patients underwent amputation for uncontrolled local progression of disease. CONCLUSIONS: Osseous metastasis from melanoma behaves aggressively. The rate of local progression is substantial, and two of 37 patients in this series required amputation for progressive disease. Despite the poor overall prognosis, local control of bone disease is an important issue, and patients may benefit from resection of osseous metastases, particularly if prior radiation has failed.	3a
20368569	Prognostic accuracy of computed tomography findings for patients with laryngeal cancer undergoing laryngectomy.	PURPOSE: The indications for upfront laryngectomy in the management of laryngeal cancer are a functionless larynx and extralaryngeal extension. Practically, clinicians rely on imaging to predict which patients will have T4 disease. Our goal was to review the accuracy of preoperative computed tomography (CT) scanning in determining the necessity for initial laryngectomy for advanced laryngeal cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In total, 107 consecutive untreated laryngectomy specimens with high-quality, preoperative CT imaging interpreted by our neuroradiologists were reviewed. Radiographic findings, including sclerosis, invasion, penetration, extralaryngeal spread, and subglottic extension were correlated with pathologic findings. CT images were not reinterpreted, since our purpose was to assess the original interpretations. RESULTS: CT imaging reported 23 cases of thyroid cartilage penetration and 27 cases of extralaryngeal spread. Pathology reported 12 cases of thyroid cartilage invasion, 29 cases of penetration, and 45 cases of extralaryngeal disease. CT imaging identified 17 (59%) of 29 cases of pathologically documented thyroid cartilage penetration and 22 (49%) of 45 cases of pathologically documented extralaryngeal spread. Pathologically proven extralaryngeal spread without thyroid cartilage penetration occurred in 18 (40%) of 45 cases. The positive predictive values for thyroid cartilage penetration and extralaryngeal spread were 74% and 81%. Sclerosis was of limited value in predicting thyroid cartilage invasion or penetration. Cricoid or arytenoid destruction predicted for thyroid cartilage penetration at rates of 57% and 63%. CONCLUSION: CT imaging has clear limitations when deciding whether there is thyroid cartilage penetration or extralaryngeal spread of advanced laryngeal cancer. Extralaryngeal spread without thyroid cartilage penetration was more common than expected. Alternate methods of pretreatment assessment are needed.	4
30079756	A Large Randomized Trial: Effects of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) for Breast Cancer (BC) Survivors on Salivary Cortisol and IL-6.	Breast cancer survivors (BCS) often experience psychological and physiological symptoms after cancer treatment. Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), a complementary and alternative therapy, has reduced subjective measures of stress, anxiety, and fatigue among BCS. Little is known, however, about how MBSR affects objective markers of stress, specifically the stress hormone cortisol and the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6). In the present study, BCS ( N = 322) were randomly assigned to a 6-week MBSR program for BC or usual-care control. Measurements of cortisol, IL-6, symptoms, and quality of life were obtained at orientation and 6 weeks. Cortisol and IL-6 were also measured prior to and after the MBSR(BC) class Weeks 1 and 6. The mean age of participants was 56.6 years and 69.4% were White non-Hispanic. Most had Stage I (33.8%) or II (35.7%) BC, and 35.7% had received chemotherapy and radiation. Cortisol levels were reduced immediately following MBSR(BC) class compared to before the class Weeks 1 and 6 (Wilcoxon-signed rank test; p < .01, d = .52-.56). IL-6 was significantly reduced from pre- to postclass at Week 6 (Wilcoxon-signed rank test; p < .01, d = .21). No differences were observed between the MBSR(BC) and control groups from baseline to Week 6 using linear mixed models. Significant relationships with small effect sizes were observed between IL-6 and both symptoms and quality of life in both groups. Results support the use of MBSR(BC) to reduce salivary cortisol and IL-6 levels in the short term in BCS.	2b
27711083	RADVAN: a randomised phase 2 trial of WBRT plus vandetanib for melanoma brain metastases - results and lessons learnt.	BACKGROUND: Brain metastases occur in up to 75% of patients with advanced melanoma. Most are treated with whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT), with limited effectiveness. Vandetanib, an inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor, epidermal growth factor receptor and rearranged during transfection tyrosine kinases, is a potent radiosensitiser in xenograft models. We compared WBRT with WBRT plus vandetanib in the treatment of patients with melanoma brain metastases. METHODS: In this double-blind, multi-centre, phase 2 trial patients with melanoma brain metastases were randomised to receive WBRT (30 Gy in 10 fractions) plus 3 weeks of concurrent vandetanib 100 mg once daily or placebo. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival in brain (PFS brain). The main study was preceded by a safety run-in phase to confirm tolerability of the combination. A post-hoc analysis and literature review considered barriers to recruiting patients with melanoma brain metastases to clinical trials. RESULTS: Twenty-four patients were recruited, six to the safety phase and 18 to the randomised phase. The study closed early due to poor recruitment. Median PFS brain was 3.3 months (90% confidence interval (CI): 1.6-5.6) in the vandetanib group and 2.5 months (90% CI: 0.2-4.8) in the placebo group (P=0.34). Median overall survival (OS) was 4.6 months (90% CI: 1.6-6.3) and 2.5 months (90% CI: 0.2-7.2), respectively (P=0.54). The most frequent adverse events were fatigue, alopecia, confusion and nausea. The most common barrier to study recruitment was availability of alternative treatments. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of WBRT plus vandetanib was well tolerated. Compared with WBRT alone, there was no significant improvement in PFS brain or OS, although we are unable to provide a definitive result due to poor accrual. A review of barriers to trial accrual identified several factors that affect study recruitment in this difficult disease area.	2a
16027437	Randomized trial of antioxidant vitamins to prevent acute adverse effects of radiation therapy in head and neck cancer patients.	PURPOSE: Many cancer patients take antioxidant vitamin supplements with the hope of improving the outcome of conventional therapies and of reducing the adverse effects of these treatments. A randomized trial was conducted to determine whether supplementation with antioxidant vitamins could reduce the occurrence and severity of acute adverse effects of radiation therapy and improve quality of life without compromising treatment efficacy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial among 540 head and neck cancer patients treated with radiation therapy. Patients were randomly assigned into two arms. The supplementation with alpha-tocopherol (400 IU/d) and beta-carotene (30 mg/d) or placebos was administered during radiation therapy and for 3 years thereafter. During the course of the trial, supplementation with beta-carotene was discontinued because of ethical concerns. RESULTS: Patients randomly assigned in the supplement arm tended to have less severe acute adverse effects during radiation therapy (odds ratio [OR], 0.72; 95% CI, 0.52 to 1.02). The reduction was statistically significant when the supplementation combined alpha-tocopherol and beta-carotene for adverse effects to the larynx (OR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.21 to 0.71) and overall at any site (OR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.20 to 0.74). Quality of life was not improved by the supplementation. The rate of local recurrence of the head and neck tumor tended to be higher in the supplement arm of the trial (hazard ratio, 1.37; 95% CI, 0.93 to 2.02). CONCLUSION: Supplementation with high doses of alpha-tocopherol and beta-carotene during radiation therapy could reduce the severity of treatment adverse effects. However, this trial suggests that use of high doses of antioxidants as adjuvant therapy might compromise radiation treatment efficacy.	2b
1458620	T3 laryngeal cancer: a retrospective study of the Dutch Head and Neck Oncology Cooperative Group: study design and general results.	511 Patients with T3 N0-3 M0 squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx, treated in the Netherlands from 1975 until 1984, were retrospectively analysed. Four different treatment policies were followed: primary surgery, planned combination of radiotherapy and surgery, primary radical radiotherapy, and selective radiotherapy. General results are presented. Local control rate was 72%. Regional control rate was 90% for clinically N0 patients and 78% for clinically N+ patients. Salvage therapy was overall successful in 38%. Surgical salvage for local radiation failures (with regional relapse) was successful in 69%, and for regional failures (without local relapse) in 46%. Ultimate locoregional control was 78% and, due to 8% distant metastases, 5-year actuarial corrected survival was 70%. Prognosis did not improve over the years. Corrected survival was independently correlated with tumour extension, involvement of neck nodes and treatment strategy. Corrected survival was similar for primary radiotherapy and primary surgery, but significantly better for planned combined therapy. Multiple primary tumours occurred significantly more often in male (19.5%) than in female patients (7.3%) (P = 0.05), the bronchus being most commonly affected. Cumulative actuarial risk for metachronous tumour was 15% after 5 years and 30% after 10 years so prevention and early detection of these second tumours may play the most important role in improving overall survival rates in the future.	4
23331931	Whole-body MRI with diffusion-weighted sequences compared with 18 FDG PET-CT, CT and superficial lymph node ultrasonography in the staging of advanced cutaneous melanoma: a prospective study.	OBJECTIVES: The aim of our study was to compare the diagnostic performances of non-radiating whole-body magnetic resonance imaging (wbMRI), either volumetric, with Volumetric interpolated breath-hold examination (VIBE) or metabolic, with diffusion-weighted sequences (wbMRI), with classical irradiating techniques such as PET-CT, CT and with lymph node ultrasonography (US) for the staging of advanced melanoma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-seven melanoma AJCC stage IV patients were prospectively included. All images were independently interpreted without prior knowledge of the results of studies performed with concurrent techniques, and all imaging techniques were scheduled within a mean interval of 7 days. The overall and site-specific diagnosis performances of each imaging modality were studied, as well as the interest of combined MRI VIBE and diffusion sequences. RESULTS: The number of visceral or lymph node metastases spotted was, respectively, 218, with 125 metastases for wbMRI, 191/103 for PET-CT, 209/115 for CT and 33/13 for lymph node US. No statistically significant difference (P < 0.05) of overall diagnostic performances between wbMRI (Se 84%, Sp 87.1%, PPV 89.8%, NPV 80.2%) and PET-CT (Se 79.8%, Sp 93.1%, PPV 93.2%, NPV 79.4%) was observed. No statistically significant difference was found between wbMRI and PET-CT with two channels for CT with respect to different metastatic sites. Compared with the CT, wbMRI had significantly better overall specificity (P = 0.0011) and PPV (P = 0.02). For lung exploration, sensitivity of wbMRI (51.6%) was inferior to CT (71.4%). To detect superficial metastatic lymph nodes, wbMRI and US both showed high diagnostic accuracy with no statistically significant difference. Intra-observer agreement was almost perfect for all imaging modalities considering the overall staging. Inter-observer agreement for wbMRI and diffusion alone was almost perfect except for bone and lymphatic sites. Overall diagnostic performance of diffusion alone was significantly inferior to those of combined VIBE and diffusion sequences. CONCLUSIONS: Whole-body MRI, using diffusion weighted sequences, was a reliable non-radiating imaging for staging of melanoma and offers the same diagnostic performances than combined CT, PET-CT and lymph node US.	2b
17346269	Systematic review of early vs deferred hormonal treatment of locally advanced prostate cancer: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.	OBJECTIVE: To compare the effectiveness of hormonal treatment (luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonists and/or antiandrogens) as an early or as a deferred intervention for patients with locally advanced prostate cancer (LAPC), as radiotherapy is currently the standard treatment for LAPC, with hormonal treatment considered a reserve option. METHODS: We systematically reviewed randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in patients with LAPC treated with standard care (radical prostatectomy, radiotherapy, and/or watchful waiting) or standard care plus hormonal treatment. Outcomes assessed were mortality and objective disease progression. The meta-analysis used a fixed-effects model. RESULTS: Of the 108 trials identified, seven met the inclusion criteria and were of sufficient quality to be included in the analysis. Early intervention with hormonal treatment significantly reduced all-cause mortality compared with deferred treatment (relative risk, RR, 0.86; 95% confidence interval, CI, 0.82-0.91; P < 0.001). Similarly, early vs deferred use of hormonal treatment significantly reduced: prostate cancer- specific mortality (RR 0.72; 95% CI 0.65-0.79); overall progression (RR 0.74; 0.69-0.78); local progression (RR 0.65; 0.57-0.73); and distant progression (RR 0.67; 0.61-0.74; all P < 0.001). Results were robust to changes in inclusion/exclusion criteria and use of a random-effects model for the meta-analyses. Heterogeneity and publication bias had no significant effect on the analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Early intervention with hormonal treatment for patients with LAPC provides significantly lower mortality and objective disease progression than deferring their use until standard care has failed.	1a
19467793	Natural history of clinically staged low- and intermediate-risk prostate cancer treated with monotherapeutic permanent interstitial brachytherapy.	PURPOSE: To evaluate the natural history of clinically staged low- and intermediate-risk prostate cancer treated with permanent interstitial seed implants as monotherapy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between April 1995 and May 2005, 463 patients with clinically localized prostate cancer underwent brachytherapy as the sole definitive treatment. Men who received supplemental external beam radiotherapy or androgen deprivation therapy were excluded. Dosimetric implant quality was determined based on the minimum dose that covered 90% of the target volume and the volume of the prostate gland receiving 100% of the prescribed dose. Multiple parameters were evaluated as predictors of treatment outcomes. RESULTS: The 12-year biochemical progression-free survival (bPFS), cause-specific survival, and overall survival rates for the entire cohort were 97.1%, 99.7%, and 75.4%, respectively. Only pretreatment prostate-specific antigen level, percent positive biopsy cores, and minimum dose that covered 90% of the target volume were significant predictors of biochemical recurrence. The bPFS, cause-specific survival, and overall survival rates were 97.4%, 99.6%, and 76.2%, respectively, for low-risk patients and 96.4%, 100%, and 74.0%, respectively, for intermediate-risk patients. The bPFS rate was 98.8% for low-risk patients with high-quality implants versus 92.1% for those with less adequate implants (p < 0.01), and it was 98.3% for intermediate-risk patients with high-quality implants versus 86.4% for those with less adequate implants (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: High-quality brachytherapy implants as monotherapy can provide excellent outcomes for men with clinically staged low- and intermediate-risk prostate cancer. For these men, a high-quality implant can achieve results comparable to high-quality surgery in the most favorable pathologically staged patient subgroups.	3a
21382958	Polarity Therapy for cancer-related fatigue in patients with breast cancer receiving radiation therapy: a randomized controlled pilot study.	BACKGROUND: Cancer-related fatigue (CRF) is the most frequently reported side effect of cancer and its treatment. In previous research, Polarity Therapy (PT), an energy therapy, was shown to reduce CRF in patients receiving radiation. This study reports on a small randomized clinical trial designed to collect preliminary data on the efficacy of PT compared with an active control (massage) and passive control (standard care) for CRF among cancer patients receiving radiation therapy. METHODS: Forty-five women undergoing radiation therapy for breast cancer were randomized to 1 of 3 weekly treatment conditions. Patients received standard clinical care, 3 modified massages, or 3 PT treatments. CRF and health-related quality of life (HRQL) were assessed during baseline and the 3 intervention weeks. RESULTS: TResults show CRF ratings were reduced after PT. The effect sizes for PT versus modified massage and versus standard care were small when using the primary measure of CRF (Brief Fatigue Inventory) and large when using the secondary measure of CRF (Daily CRF Diaries).The effect size was medium when assessing the benefit of PT on maintaining HRQL compared with standard care with very little difference between the PT and modified massage conditions. Patients' feedback showed that both the modified massage and PT treatments were deemed useful by radiation patients. CONCLUSION: The present pilot randomized clinical trial supports previous experimental research showing that PT, a noninvasive and gentle energy therapy, may be effective in controlling CRF. Further confirmatory studies as well as investigations of the possible mechanisms of PT are warranted.	2b
17878474	Identification of patients with prostate cancer who benefit from immediate postoperative radiotherapy: EORTC 22911.	PURPOSE: The randomized controlled European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) trial 22911 studied the effect of radiotherapy after prostatectomy in patients with adverse risk factors. Review pathology data of specimens from participants in this trial were analyzed to identify which factors predict increased benefit from adjuvant radiotherapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: After prostatectomy, 1,005 patients with stage pT3 and/or positive surgical margins were randomly assigned to a wait-and-see (n = 503) and an adjuvant radiotherapy (60 Gy conventional irradiation) arm (n = 502). Pathologic review data were available for 552 patients from 11 participating centers. The interaction between the review pathology characteristics and treatment benefit was assessed by log-rank test for heterogeneity (P < .05). RESULTS: Margin status assessed by review pathology was the strongest predictor of prolonged biochemical disease-free survival with immediate postoperative radiotherapy (heterogeneity, P < .01): by year 5, immediate postoperative irradiation could prevent 291 events/1,000 patients with positive margins versus 88 events/1,000 patients with negative margins. The hazard ratio for immediate irradiation was 0.38 (95% CI, 0.26 to 0.54) and 0.88 (95% CI, 0.53 to 1.46) in the groups with positive and negative margins, respectively. We could not identify a significant impact of the positive margin localization. CONCLUSION: Provided careful pathology of the prostatectomy is performed, our results suggest that immediate postoperative radiotherapy might not be recommended for prostate cancer patients with negative surgical margins. These findings require validation on an independent data set.	1a
21612429	Guarana (Paullinia cupana) improves fatigue in breast cancer patients undergoing systemic chemotherapy.	BACKGROUND: In patients with breast cancer (BC) undergoing systemic chemotherapy, cancer-related fatigue (CRF) is a common problem that can negatively impact quality of life. Guarana (Paullinia cupana) is a plant native to the Amazon basin that has been used as a stimulant since pre-Columbian times. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of guarana extract on fatigue, sleep quality, anxiety, depression symptoms, and menopause in a group of BC chemotherapy patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with progressive fatigue after their first cycle of chemotherapy were randomized to receive either guarana 50 mg by mouth twice daily (32 patients) or placebo (43 patients) for 21 days. After a 7-day washout period, patients were crossed over to the opposite experimental arm. All patients were evaluated on days 1, 21, and 49. The primary endpoint was the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-F) questionnaire score, and secondary endpoints were the results of the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Endocrine Symptoms (FACT-ES), Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI), Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index, Chalder Fatigue Scale, and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. RESULTS: Guarana significantly improved the FACIT-F, FACT-ES, and BFI global scores compared to placebo on days 21 and 49 (p < 0.01). The Chalder Scale improved significantly on day 21 (p < 0.01) but not on day 49 (p = 0.27). Guarana did not produce any Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events grades 2, 3, or 4 toxicities and did not worsen sleep quality or cause anxiety or depression. CONCLUSIONS: Guarana is an effective, inexpensive, and nontoxic alternative for the short-term treatment of fatigue in BC patients receiving systemic chemotherapy. Further studies are needed to confirm these results and to evaluate their generalizability to chronic CRF and to other types of cancer.	1b
22363037	Palliative chemotherapy for malignant ascites secondary to ovarian cancer.	Although research has shown that palliative chemotherapy is beneficial compared to lack of treatment (Schorge JO, Schaffer JI, Halvorson LM, et al. ed. Williams Gynecology. New York, NY: McGraw Hill Medical; 2008.), other studies show aggressive end-of-life treatment adversely affects quality of life and shortens life span (Arriba L, Fader A, Frasure H, von Gruenigen V. A review of issues surrounding quality of life among women with ovarian cancer. Gynecol Oncol. 2010;119(2):390-396.). Without a consensus on palliative chemotherapy, underutilization during end of life prevails, and likely will continue without additional research (Barbera L, Elit L, Krzyzanowska M, et al. End of life care for women with gynecologic cancers. Gynecol Oncol. 2010;118(2):196-201.). This article aims to evaluate and examine existing chemotherapy for palliation of malignant ascites secondary to ovarian cancer and compare commonly used regimens. Agents will be evaluated by their modes of administration. Oral agents include cyclophosphamide and thalidomide, and intraperitoneal vehicles include taxane-based agents, platinum-based agents, antibiotics, and biologic agents. In addition, cost, ethics, and quality of life discussions factor into this review. Palliative care's goal is to find a balance between life expectancy and symptom relief with minimal adverse effects.	1b
27709351	Adverse effects of non-hormonal pharmacological interventions in breast cancer survivors, suffering from hot flashes: A systematic review and meta-analysis.	PURPOSE: To access frequency and severity of adverse effects (AE) of non-hormonal drugs (NHD) for hot flashes in breast cancer survivors compared to controls and analyze adverse-effect risk by reviewing published randomized trials. METHODS: Cochrane Central Register for Controlled Trials, Embase, Medline, PsycINFO and PubMed databases were searched. Trials were included where participants were survivors of breast cancer suffering from hot flashes, treatment included self-administered venlafaxine, gabapentin or clonidine, and AE were reported. AE frequency and severity were graded. A meta-analysis of ten trials with sub-group analyses was conducted. RESULTS: Forty-nine studies were identified, and 12 were included. A total of 1467 participants experienced 772 adverse effects, 81 % (n = 627) in the treatment group and 19 % (n = 145) in the control group. Sixty-seven percent of AE was graded as mild and 33 % as moderate. The frequency of AE for NHD was overall significant compared to placebo. Sub-group analysis indicated that AE frequency and severity increased at higher doses of venlafaxine and gabapentin compared to placebo. CONCLUSION: The odds for experiencing AE was significantly higher in patients randomized to high-dose NHD than those randomized to controls, including placebo, low-dose medication and acupuncture. These therapies should be considered as a potential treatment alternative.	2a
18375891	Randomized trial of intravenous iron supplementation in patients with chemotherapy-related anemia without iron deficiency treated with darbepoetin alpha.	PURPOSE: Unresponsiveness to erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, occurring in 30% to 50% of patients, is a major limitation to the treatment of chemotherapy-related anemia. We have prospectively evaluated whether intravenous iron can increase the proportion of patients with chemotherapy-related anemia who respond to darbepoetin. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between December 2004 and February 2006, 149 patients with lung, gynecologic, breast, and colorectal cancers and >or= 12 weeks of planned chemotherapy were enrolled from 33 institutions. Patients were required to have hemoglobin <or= 11 g/L and no absolute or functional iron deficiency. All patients received darbepoetin 150 microg subcutaneously once weekly for 12 weeks and were randomly assigned to sodium ferric gluconate 125 mg intravenously (IV) weekly for the first 6 weeks (n = 73) or no iron (n = 76). Primary end point of the study was the percentage of patients achieving hematopoietic response (hemoglobin >or= 12 g/dL or >or= 2 g/dL increase). RESULTS: Hematopoietic response by intention-to-treat analysis was 76.7% (95%CI, 65.4% to 85.8%) in the darbepoetin/iron group and 61.8% (95%CI, 50.0% to 72.7%) in the darbepoetin group (P = .0495). Among patients fulfilling eligibility criteria and having received at least four darbepoetin administrations, hematopoietic responses in the darbepoetin/iron group (n = 53) and in the darbepoetin-only group (n = 50) were 92.5% (95% CI, 81.8% to 97.9%) and 70% (95% CI, 55.4% to 82.1%), respectively (P = .0033). Increase of hemoglobin during treatment period showed a time profile favoring darbepoetin/iron with statistically significant effect from week 5 on. The safety profile was comparable in the two arms. CONCLUSION: In patients with chemotherapy-related anemia and no iron deficiency, IV iron supplementation significantly reduces treatment failures to darbepoetin without additional toxicity.	1b
26319842	ROLE OF PARENTERAL NUTRITION IN ONCOLOGIC PATIENTS WITH INTESTINAL OCCLUSION AND PERITONEAL CARCINOMATOSIS.	INTRODUCTION AND AIMS: the precise role of parenteral nutrition in the management of oncologic patients with intestinal occlusion is not well defined yet. We aimed to identify the effects of parenteral nutrition in these patients regarding prognosis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 55 patients with intestinal occlusion and peritoneal carcinomatosis were included. Parenteral nutrition aimed at 20-35 kcal/Kg/day, and 1.0 g/kg/day of amino-acids. Weight, body mass index, type of tumor, type of chemotherapy, and ECOG among others were recorded and analyzed. RESULTS: 69.1% of the patients had gastrointestinal tumors, 18.2% gynecologic and 12.7% others. Age was 60 +/- 13y, baseline ECOG 1.5 +/- 0.5 and body mass index 21.6 +/- 4.3. Malnutrition was present in 85%. Survival from the start of parenteral nutrition was not significant when considering baseline ECOG (log rank = 0.593, p = 0.743), previous lines of chemotherapy (log rank = 2.117, p = 0.548), baseline BMI (log rank = 2.686, p = 0.261), or type of tumor (log rank = 2.066, p = 0.356). Survival in patients who received home parenteral nutrition after hospital discharge was higher than those who stayed in-hospital (log rank = 7.090, p = 0.008). Survival in patients who started chemotherapy during or after parenteral nutrition was higher than those who did not so (log rank = 17.316, p < 0.001). A total of 3.6% of patients presented catheter related infection without affecting survival (log rank = 0.061, p = 0.804). CONCLUSIONS: Parenteral nutrition in patients with advanced cancer and intestinal occlusion is safe, and in tho se who respond to chemotherapy, further administration of home parenteral nutrition together with chemotherapy may enhance prolonged survival.	3a
15310779	The microanatomic location of metastatic melanoma in sentinel lymph nodes predicts nonsentinel lymph node involvement.	PURPOSE: Sentinel node biopsy is now widely accepted as the most accurate prognostic indicator in melanoma, and is important in guiding management of patients with clinical stage I or II disease. Patients with a positive sentinel node have conventionally undergone completion lymphadenectomy (CLND) of the involved basin, but only 20% have involvement beyond the sentinel node, suggesting that CLND may be unnecessary for the other 80% of patients. This study seeks to identify criteria that might be used to be more restrictive in selecting those who should undergo CLND. METHODS: A total of 146 patients were identified who had had a positive sentinel node biopsy for malignant melanoma. Their sentinel nodes and lymphadenectomy specimens were re-evaluated pathologically. The metastatic melanoma in each sentinel node was assessed according to its microanatomic location within the node (subcapsular, combined subcapsular and parenchymal, parenchymal, multifocal, or extensive), and this was correlated with the presence of involved nonsentinel nodes in the CLND. The depth of the metastases from the sentinel node capsule was also recorded. RESULTS: The metastatic deposits in the sentinel node were subcapsular in 26.0% of patients. None of these patients had any nonsentinel nodes involved on CLND. In the patients whose sentinel node metastases had a different microanatomic location, the rate of nonsentinel node involvement was 22.2% overall. CONCLUSION: The microanatomic location of metastases within sentinel nodes predicts nonsentinel lymph node involvement. In patients with only subcapsular deposits in the sentinel node, it is possible that CLND could safely be avoided.	3b
28965138	Enhancing an oncologist's recommendation to exercise to manage fatigue levels in breast cancer patients: a randomized controlled trial.	PURPOSE: Fatigue is a troublesome symptom for breast cancer patients, which might be mitigated with exercise. Cancer patients often prefer their oncologist recommend an exercise program, yet a recommendation alone may not be enough to change behavior. Our study determined whether adding an exercise DVD to an oncologist's recommendation to exercise led to better outcomes than a recommendation alone. METHODS: Ninety breast cancer patients, at varying phases of treatment and stages of disease, were randomized to receive the following: an oncologist verbal recommendation to exercise (REC; n = 43) or REC plus a cancer-specific yoga DVD (REC + DVD; n = 47). Fatigue, vigor, and depression subscales of the Profile of Mood States, and physical activity levels (MET-min/week), exercise readiness, and self-efficacy were assessed at baseline, 4, and 8 weeks. Analyses controlled for age, time since diagnosis, and metastatic disease. RESULTS: Over 8 weeks, women in REC + DVD used the DVD an average of twice per week. The REC + DVD group had greater reductions in fatigue (- 1.9 +/- 5.0 vs. - 1.0 +/- 3.5, p = 0.02), maintained exercise readiness (- 0.1 +/- 1.1 vs. - 0.3 +/- 1.3; p = 0.03), and reported less of a decrease in physical activity (- 420 +/- 3075 vs. - 427 +/- 5060 MET-min/week, p = 0.06) compared to REC only. CONCLUSIONS: A low-cost, easily distributed, and scalable yoga-based DVD could be a simple booster to an oncologist's advice that motivates breast cancer patients, even those with advanced disease and/or in treatment, to engage in self-care, e.g., exercise, to manage fatigue. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03120819.	2b
31531779	Significant risk of occult cancer in complex non-atypical endometrial hyperplasia.	BACKGROUND: In the 2014 WHO classification of endometrial hyperplasia (EH), complex EH is lumped together with simple EH in the benign category of non-atypical EH. OBJECTIVE: To assess the risk of coexistent cancer in complex EH and simple EH without atypia, through a systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS: Electronic databases were searched from their inception to January 2019 for relevant articles. RESULTS: Twelve studies assessing a total of 804 non-atypical EH were included. The risk of coexistent cancer was significantly higher in complex EH (12.4%) than in simple EH (2%), with an OR of 6.03 (p = 0.0002). CONCLUSION: Even in the absence of cytologic atypia, complex EH is associated with a significant risk of coexistent cancer. Further studies are necessary to investigate the need for a revision in the WHO classification.	3a
10221265	High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) followed after one to two weeks by radical retropubic prostatectomy: results of a prospective study.	BACKGROUND: High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) consists of focused ultrasound waves emitted from a transducer that are capable of inducing tissue damage. Experimental studies have shown clear damage of malignant tissue exposed to HIFU, but knowledge of in vivo effects is limited. We studied the safety and efficacy of HIFU in patients with a T1-2 N0) M0 prostate carcinoma. METHODS: HIFU treatment was performed under general anesthesia with the Ablatherm device (Technomed Medical Systems, Lyon, France), 7-12 days prior to radical prostatectomy. Only the lobe in which carcinoma was confirmed was treated. The radical prostatectomy specimen was examined histopathologically, and the changes were compared with treatment goals. RESULTS: So far, 9 patients have been treated. On histology, a sharp delineation was noted between areas treated with HIFU and untreated areas. On the dorsal border, however, incomplete destruction of tissue was noted, and in 2 cases a small residual tumor was seen in this region. In all cases complete necrosis was seen in the treated region. CONCLUSIONS: Histology reports of radical prostatectomy specimens of patients operated 7-12 days after HIFU treatment showed marked and complete necrosis in the treated area. Due to incomplete tissue destruction at the dorsal side, however, a small focus of residual vital tumor was found in 2 of 9 patients.	3a
15629603	FDG-PET/CT imaging for preradiotherapy staging of head-and-neck squamous cell carcinoma.	PURPOSE: Image localization of head-and-neck squamous cell carcinoma lags behind current techniques to deliver a precise radiation dose with intensity-modulated radiotherapy. This pilot study prospectively examined the use of registered 18-F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET)/CT for preradiotherapy staging of the neck. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Sixty-three patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity, oropharynx, larynx, or hypopharynx were enrolled into an institutional FDG-PET imaging protocol between September 2000 and June 2003. Of these patients, 20 went on to immediate neck dissection surgery and were studied further. Of these 20, 17 (85%) had American Joint Committee on Cancer Stage III or IV disease. All patients underwent preoperative FDG-PET and contrast-enhanced CT of the head and neck. FDG-PET/CT images were created using a nonrigid image registration algorithm developed at the University of Washington. Alternate primary and nodal gross tumor volumes were contoured with radiotherapy treatment planning software, blinded to each other and to the pathology results. One set of volumes was designed with CT guidance alone and the other with the corresponding FDG-PET/CT images. Neck dissection specimens were subdivided into surgical nodal levels intraoperatively, and the histopathologic findings were correlated with the CT and FDG-PET/CT nodal level findings. RESULTS: FDG-PET/CT detected 17 of 17 heminecks and 26 of 27 nodal zones histologically positive by dissection (100% and 96% sensitivity, respectively). The nodal level staging sensitivity and specificity for FDG-PET/CT was 96% (26 of 27) and 98.5% (68 of 69), respectively. FDG-PET/CT correctly detected nodal disease in 2 patients considered to have node-negative disease by CT alone. Agreement between the imaging results and pathology findings was stronger for FDG-PET/CT (kappa 0.95, 95% confidence interval 0.82-0.99) than for CT alone (kappa 0.81, 95% confidence interval 0.63-0.91; p = 0.06 by two-sided McNemar's testing). CONCLUSION: These early findings suggest that FDG-PET/CT is superior to CT alone for geographic localization of diseased neck node levels. Confirmatory trials to substantiate the accuracy of FDG-PET/CT neck staging should be prioritized.	4
23347311	A 10-year analysis of primary cutaneous malignant melanoma with sentinel lymph node biopsy and long-term follow-up.	BACKGROUND: Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is an important tool for accurate staging of patients with melanoma. There is an ongoing debate whether the procedure provides therapeutic benefits or not. OBJECTIVE: We wanted to analyze 10-year data from an academic teaching hospital. PATIENTS AND METHODS: During 1999-2009, 977 patients with early cutaneous melanoma have been treated. Of these, 419 patients had tumors >/= 1 mm thickness. Patients with head and neck tumors were excluded, leaving 364 patients (202 men and 162 women). SLNB was not performed in 163 patients but was performed in 201 patients. For correction of bias, tumors >4 mm thickness were excluded from further statistical analysis. RESULTS: The detection rate of SLN was 94.4%. False negative SLN were observed in 8.9%. Adverse effects occurred in 5.5%. The rate of positive SLNB was 16.4% and lymph node involvement 20%. Patients undergoing SLNB had a lower relapse rate (10.6% vs. 33.3%; P < 0.001). The most important finding is an almost 50% lower total death rate and melanoma-related death rate in the SLNB subgroup (P < 0.001 for both). CONCLUSIONS: Sentinel lymph node biopsy is an accurate instrument for melanoma staging to detect occult regional lymph node involvement. Data suggest a positive effect on relapse-free survival. The observation of improved long-term survival needs validation in prospective multicenter trials. The limitations of this study were that it was a single center retrospective analysis.	3a
31086306	The proportion of endometrial cancers associated with Lynch syndrome: a systematic review of the literature and meta-analysis.	PURPOSE: Endometrial cancer (EC) is often the sentinel cancer in women with Lynch syndrome (LS). However, efforts to implement universal LS screening in EC patients have been hampered by a lack of evidence detailing the proportion of EC patients that would be expected to screen positive for LS. METHODS: Studies were identified by electronic searches of Medline, Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL and Web of Science. Proportions of test positivity were calculated by random and fixed-effects meta-analysis models. I(2) score was used to assess heterogeneity across studies. RESULTS: Fifty-three studies, including 12,633 EC patients, met the inclusion criteria. The overall proportion of endometrial tumors with microsatellite instability or mismatch repair (MMR) deficiency by immunohistochemistry (IHC) was 0.27 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.25-0.28, I(2): 71%) and 0.26 (95% CI 0.25-0.27, I(2): 88%), respectively. Of those women with abnormal tumor testing, 0.29 (95% CI 0.25-0.33, I(2): 83%) had LS-associated pathogenic variants on germline testing; therefore around 3% of ECs can be attributed to LS. Preselection of EC cases did increase the proportion of germline LS diagnoses. CONCLUSION: The current study suggests that prevalence of LS in EC patients is approximately 3%, similar to that of colorectal cancer patients; therefore our data support the implementation of universal EC screening for LS.	2a
16622261	Immediate or deferred androgen deprivation for patients with prostate cancer not suitable for local treatment with curative intent: European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Trial 30891.	PURPOSE: This study (EORTC 30891) attempted to demonstrate equivalent overall survival in patients with localized prostate cancer not suitable for local curative treatment treated with immediate or deferred androgen ablation. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We randomly assigned 985 patients with newly diagnosed prostate cancer T0-4 N0-2 M0 to receive androgen deprivation either immediately (n = 493) or on symptomatic disease progression or occurrence of serious complications (n = 492). RESULTS: Baseline characteristics were well balanced in the two groups. Median age was 73 years (range, 52 to 81). At a median follow-up of 7.8 years, 541 of 985 patients had died, mostly of prostate cancer (n = 193) or cardiovascular disease (n = 185). The overall survival hazard ratio was 1.25 (95% CI, 1.05 to 1.48; noninferiority P > .1) favoring immediate treatment, seemingly due to fewer deaths of nonprostatic cancer causes (P = .06). The time from randomization to progression of hormone refractory disease did not differ significantly, nor did prostate-cancer specific survival. The median time to the start of deferred treatment after study entry was 7 years. In this group 126 patients (25.6%) died without ever needing treatment (44% of the deaths in this arm). CONCLUSION: Immediate androgen deprivation resulted in a modest but statistically significant increase in overall survival but no significant difference in prostate cancer mortality or symptom-free survival. This must be weighed on an individual basis against the adverse effects of life-long androgen deprivation, which may be avoided in a substantial number of patients with a deferred treatment policy.	1b
28077359	Indoor Tanning and Melanoma Risk: Long-Term Evidence From a Prospective Population-Based Cohort Study.	Indoor tanning is associated with increased risk of melanoma, but most evidence comes from case-control studies. Using data from the Norwegian Women and Cancer Study, a large prospective cohort study, we investigated the associations of age at initiation of indoor tanning, duration of tanning-device use, and dose response with melanoma risk and examined the role of indoor tanning in age at melanoma diagnosis. We used Poisson regression to estimate relative risks and 95% confidence intervals for the relationship of indoor tanning to melanoma risk and linear regression to examine age of indoor tanning initiation in relation to age at diagnosis. During follow-up of 141,045 women (1991-2012; mean duration follow-up = 13.7 years), 861 women were diagnosed with melanoma. Melanoma risk increased with increasing cumulative number of tanning sessions (for highest tertile of use vs. never use, adjusted relative risk = 1.32, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.08, 1.63); P-trend = 0.006. Age at initiation <30 years was associated with a higher risk in comparison with never use (adjusted relative risk = 1.31, 95% CI: 1.07, 1.59). Moreover, women who started indoor tanning prior to 30 years of age were 2.2 years (95% CI: 0.9, 3.4) younger at diagnosis, on average, than never users. This cohort study provides strong evidence of a dose-response association between indoor tanning and risk of melanoma and supports the hypothesis that vulnerability to the harmful effects of indoor tanning is greater at a younger age.	2b
17118024	Efficacy of primary hormonal therapy for patients with localized and locally advanced prostate cancer: a retrospective multicenter study.	AIM: A retrospective review of patients with localized and locally advanced prostate cancer was performed to evaluate the efficacy of primary hormonal therapy and predict long-term prognosis in these patients. METHODS: A total of 628 patients who were diagnosed with stage T1c to T3 prostate cancer were treated with primary hormonal therapy at participating institutions. The patients were classified based on pretreatment prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, Gleason score, and time to nadir PSA level. Disease-specific and progression-free survival rates were investigated, and compared among the subgroups. RESULTS: The mean age of patients was 74.5 years, and median pretreatment PSA level was 14.0 ng/mL. A total of 399 patients (63.5%) were treated with combined androgen blockade (CAB), and 229 patients (36.5%) were treated with castration monotherapy. The disease-specific survival rate of all 628 patients was 89.1% at 8 years. The group that showed a good response to primary hormonal therapy (Group G, pretreatment PSA level < or =20 ng/mL, Gleason score < or =7, and time to nadir PSA < or =6 months) accounted for approximately one-third of the total number of T1c-T3 patients. Disease-specific and progression-free survival rates at 8 years in Group G were 98.9% and 82.0%, respectively. These rates increased to 100% and 87.3%, respectively, in patients receiving CAB treatment in Group G. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate the usefulness of primary hormonal therapy, especially CAB treatment, for patients showing a good response to hormonal therapy in long-term control of localized and locally advanced prostate cancer.	2a
24099839	Prevention of blood transfusion with intravenous iron in gynecologic cancer patients receiving platinum-based chemotherapy.	OBJECTIVES: To compare the efficacy of intravenous iron and oral iron for prevention of blood transfusions in gynecologic cancer patients receiving platinum-based chemotherapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty-four non anemic gynecologic cancer patients receiving adjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy were stratified and randomized according to baseline hemoglobin levels and chemotherapy regimen. The study group received 200mg of intravenous iron sucrose immediately after each chemotherapy infusion. The control group received oral ferrous fumarate at a dose of 200mg three times a day. Complete blood count was monitored before each chemotherapy infusion. Blood transfusions were given if hemoglobin level was below 10mg/dl. RESULTS: There were 32 patients in each group. No significant differences in baseline hemoglobin levels and baseline characteristics were demonstrated between both groups. Nine patients (28.1%) in the study group and 18 patients (56.3%) in the control group required blood transfusion through 6 cycles of chemotherapy (p=0.02). Fewer median number of total packed red cell units were required in the study group compared to the control group (0 and 0.5 unit, respectively, p=0.04). Serious adverse events and hypersensitivity reactions were not reported. However, constipation was significantly higher in the control group (3.1% and 40.6%, p=<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Intravenous iron is an effective, well-tolerated treatment for primary prevention of blood transfusions in gynecologic cancer patients receiving platinum-based chemotherapy, associated with less constipation than the oral formulation.	2b
19039054	A systematic review of specialised palliative care for terminal patients: which model is better?	There is evidence of improved effectiveness of specialised palliative care for terminally ill patients in comparison to conventional care. However, there is uncertainty about which model is better. The objective of this systematic review was to identify studies that compare specialised palliative care models between them assessing their effectiveness or cost-effectiveness. We searched studies published between 2003 and 2006 in several electronic databases and updated the search in MEDLINE up to 2008. Papers published before 2003 were identified by means of previous systematic reviews and manual search. Studies with broad designs comparing two or more specialised palliative care programmes in adults with terminal illness were selected. Six systematic reviews, three studies on effectiveness and one cost study were included. All systematic reviews drew the conclusion that specialised palliative care is more effective than conventional care. The methodological limitations of the original studies and the heterogeneity of programmes did not allow to draw conclusions about whether a specific model of specialised palliative care is more or less effective or cost-effective than other.	1a
29567052	The efficacy and safety of topical tranexamic acid: A systematic review and meta-analysis.	Tranexamic acid (TXA) is an effective hemostatic agent used for the reduction of blood loss and transfusion. However, the safety profile of TXA remains in question due to a potential increased risk of venous thromboembolism. By applying TXA topically as opposed to intravenously, systemic absorption may be reduced and unwanted side-effects mitigated. The objective of our review is to investigate the efficacy and safety of topically applied tranexamic acid compared to both placebo, and the intravenous administration. Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase, ISI Web of Science, PubMed, and Clinicaltrials.gov were searched from inception to November, 2016. We included randomized controlled trials that compared topical tranexamic acid to either placebo (or standard care) or intravenous administration, in adult patients. Surgical and non-surgical trials were included. Abstract, full-text selection, data extraction and risk of bias assessment were all performed in duplicate. In total, 67 studies involving 6,034 patients met inclusion criteria. The majority of trials evaluated orthopedic procedures. Compared to placebo, the administration of topical TXA significantly reduced the odds of receiving a blood transfusion (pooled OR 0.28, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.38; P < 0.001) and significantly reduced mean blood loss (WMD -276.6, 95% CI -327.8 to -225.4; P < 0.0001). When compared to the intravenous administration, there was no difference between the two groups in terms of transfusion requirements (pooled OR 1.03, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.46; P=0.88) or blood loss (WMD -21.95, 95% CI -66.61 to 27.71; P=0.34). There was no difference in the odds of developing a venous thromboembolic complication between the topical TXA and control groups (pooled OR=0.78, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.29; P=0.33) or the topical and intravenous groups (pooled OR=0.75, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.46; P=0.40). The topical application of TXA effectively reduces both transfusion risk and blood loss compared to placebo, without increasing thromboembolic risks. There were no major differences between topical and intravenous tranexamic acid with respect to safety and efficacy, and both were superior to placebo with regards to blood loss and transfusion requirements. Further study of the topical application is required outside of the field of orthopedics.	1a
23262808	Touch, Caring, and Cancer: randomized controlled trial of a multimedia caregiver education program.	PURPOSE: A randomized controlled trial was conducted to evaluate outcomes of a multimedia instructional program for family caregivers in simple touch-based techniques to provide comfort to cancer patients at home. METHODS: A multilingual 78-min DVD and 66-page manual were produced for homebased instruction. Content addresses attitudes and communication about touch in cancer, psychological preparation for giving and receiving touch, safety precautions, massage techniques for comfort and relaxation, acupressure for specific cancer-related symptoms, and practice in the home setting. Materials were produced in English, Spanish, and Chinese versions. A community-based multiethnic sample of 97 adult patient/caregiver dyads was randomized to experimental (massage) or attention control (reading) groups for 4 weeks. Massage dyads received the program and instructions to practice at least three times per week, while control caregivers read to their patients for the same frequency. Self-report instruments assessed change in symptom severity, quality of life, perceived stress, and caregiver attitudes. RESULTS: Significant reductions in all symptoms occurred for patients after both activities: 12-28 % reductions after reading vs. 29-44 % after massage. Massage caregivers showed significant gains in confidence, comfort, and self-efficacy using touch and massage as forms of caregiving. CONCLUSIONS: Multimedia instruction in touch and massage methods may offer family members a viable means of enhancing self-efficacy and satisfaction in caregiving while decreasing patient pain, depression, and other symptoms. Family members may be able to learn and apply safe and simple methods that increase patient comfort and reduce distress.	2b
15651057	Survival in prostate carcinoma--outcomes from a prospective, population-based cohort of 8887 men with up to 15 years of follow-up: results from three countries in the population-based National Prostate Cancer Registry of Sweden.	BACKGROUND: To decide on screening strategies and curative treatments for prostate carcinoma, it is necessary to determine the incidence and survival in a population that is not screened. METHODS: The 15-year projected survival data were analyzed from a prospective, complete, population-based registry of 8887 patients with newly diagnosed prostate carcinoma from 1987 to 1999. RESULTS: The median patient age at diagnosis was 75 years (range, 40-96 years), and 12% of patients were diagnosed before the age 65 years. The median follow-up was 80 months for patients who remained alive. In total, 5873 of 8887 patients (66.1%) had died, and 2595 of those patients (44.2%) died directly due to prostate carcinoma. The overall median age at death was 80 years (range, 41-100 years). The projected 15-year disease-specific survival rate was 44% for the whole population. In total, 18% of patients had metastases at diagnosis (M1), and their median survival was 2.5 years. Patients with nonmetastatic T1-T3 prostate carcinoma (age < 75 years at diagnosis; n=2098 patients) had a 15-year projected disease-specific survival rate of 66%. Patients who underwent radical prostatectomy had a significantly lower risk of dying from prostate carcinoma (relative risk, 0.40) compared with patients who were treated with noncurative therapies or radiotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: The disease-specific mortality was comparatively high, but it took 15 years to reach a disease-specific mortality rate of 56%. These data form a truly population-based baseline on how prostate carcinoma will affect a population when screening is not applied and can be used for comparison with other health care strategies.	2a
18543381	Medical Qigong for cancer patients: pilot study of impact on quality of life, side effects of treatment and inflammation.	Quality of life (QOL) of cancer patients is often diminished due to the side effects of treatment and symptoms of the disease itself. Medical Qigong (coordination of gentle exercise and relaxation through meditation and breathing exercise based on Chinese medicine theory of energy channels) may be an effective therapy for improving QOL, symptoms and side effects, and longevity of cancer patients. In this pilot study, the feasibility, acceptability, and impact of Medical Qigong (MQ) were evaluated on outcomes in cancer patients. Thirty patients diagnosed with heterogeneous cancers, were randomly assigned to two groups: a control group that received usual medical care and an intervention group who participated in a MQ program for 8 weeks in addition to receiving usual medical care. Randomization was stratified by completion of cancer treatment (n = 14) or under chemotherapy (n = 16). Patients completed measures before and after the program. Quality of life and symptoms were measured by the EORTC QLQ-C 30 and progress of disease by the inflammation biomarker (CRP: c-reactive protein) via a blood test was assessed. The MQ intervention group reported clinically significant improved global QOL scores pre- and post-intervention. The MQ intervention also reduced the symptoms of side effects of cancer treatment and inflammation biomarker (CRP) compare to the control group. Due to the small sample size, however, the results were not statistically significant between treatment and the control groups. Data from the pilot study suggest that MQ with usual medical treatment can enhance the QOL of cancer patients and reduce inflammation. This study needs a further investigation with a larger sample size.	1b
10082040	Management of symptomatic malignant melanoma of the gastrointestinal tract.	BACKGROUND: Melanoma metastatic to the gastrointestinal (GI) tract is asymptomatic or presents with pain, bleeding, or obstruction. To determine whether surgery influences outcomes, we reviewed our experience with this patient population. METHODS: Medical records of patients with metastatic melanoma to the GI tract were reviewed. Patients were divided into four groups, i.e., complete resection, partial debulking, unresectable, or unexplored. Analysis was performed using the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: Fifty patients with melanoma metastatic to the GI tract were identified (40 men and 10 women; mean age, 44 years). Presenting symptoms included pain (62%), bleeding (28%), and obstruction (18%). Diagnosis was confirmed using contrast studies (38%), endoscopy (20%), or computed tomography (30%). Thirty-six patients (61%) underwent a total of 39 operations. Seventeen patients underwent complete resection, whereas 14 underwent partial debulking. Five patients had unresectable lesions, and 14 patients did not undergo exploration because of medical contraindications. The operative mortality rate was 2.5% (1 of 39). The mean survival times for the unexplored and unresected groups were similar (4.1 months). Patients who underwent partial resection exhibited a longer mean survival time (8.9 months) than did patients in the unresected group (P < .001). The complete-resection group demonstrated a mean survival time of 23.5 months, which was significantly longer than that for patients who underwent less than complete resection (P < .0001). CONCLUSIONS: Metastatic melanoma to the GI tract can result in significant morbidity and death. Surgical resection can be performed safely. Patients for whom all sites of disease are completely resected experience significant improvements in survival times, compared with patients who undergo less than complete resection. For selected patients, surgical treatment of metastatic melanoma involving the GI tract is appropriate therapy.	3b
16455635	The detection of bone metastases in patients with high-risk prostate cancer: 99mTc-MDP Planar bone scintigraphy, single- and multi-field-of-view SPECT, 18F-fluoride PET, and 18F-fluoride PET/CT.	UNLABELLED: The aim of this study was to compare the detection of bone metastases by 99mTc-methylene diphosphonate (99mTc-MDP) planar bone scintigraphy (BS), SPECT, 18F-Fluoride PET, and 18F-Fluoride PET/CT in patients with high-risk prostate cancer. METHODS: In a prospective study, BS and 18F-Fluoride PET/CT were performed on the same day in 44 patients with high-risk prostate cancer. In 20 of the latter patients planar BS was followed by single field-of-view (FOV) SPECT and in 24 patients by multi-FOV SPECT of the axial skeleton. Lesions were interpreted separately on each of the 4 modalities as normal, benign, equivocal, or malignant. RESULTS: In patient-based analysis, 23 patients had skeletal metastatic spread (52%) and 21 did not. Categorizing equivocal and malignant interpretation as suggestive for malignancy, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of planar BS were 70%, 57%, 64%, and 55%, respectively, of multi-FOV SPECT were 92%, 82%, 86%, and 90%, of (18)F-Fluoride PET were 100%, 62%, 74%, and 100%, and of 18F-Fluoride PET/CT were 100% for all parameters. Using the McNemar test, 18F-Fluoride PET/CT was statistically more sensitive and more specific than planar or SPECT BS (P < 0.05) and more specific than 18F-Fluoride PET (P < 0.001). SPECT was statistically more sensitive and more specific than planar BS (P < 0.05) but was less sensitive than 18F-Fluoride PET (P < 0.05). In lesion-based analysis, 156 lesions with increased uptake of 18F-Fluoride were assessed. Based on the corresponding appearance on CT, lesions were categorized by PET/CT as benign (n = 99), osteoblastic metastasis (n = 46), or equivocal when CT was normal (n = 11). Of the 156 18F-Fluoride lesions, 81 lesions (52%), including 34 metastases, were overlooked with normal appearance on planar BS. SPECT identified 62% of the lesions overlooked by planar BS. 18F-Fluoride PET/CT was more sensitive and more specific than BS (P < 0.001) and more specific than PET alone (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: 18F-Fluoride PET/CT is a highly sensitive and specific modality for detection of bone metastases in patients with high-risk prostate cancer. It is more specific than 18F-Fluoride PET alone and more sensitive and specific than planar and SPECT BS. Detection of bone metastases is improved by SPECT compared with planar BS and by 18F-Fluoride PET compared with SPECT. This added value of 18F-Fluoride PET/CT may beneficially impact the clinical management of patients with high-risk prostate cancer.	3a
23106176	Weight loss in patients with head and neck cancer during and after conventional and accelerated radiotherapy.	BACKGROUND: Weight loss is common among patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) and is mainly due to tumor and treatment related factors. The aim of the present study was to evaluate weight loss in patients with SCCHN undergoing two different radiotherapy (RT) schedules. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Nutritional data were analyzed from the ARTSCAN study, a controlled randomized prospective Swedish multicenter study conducted with the aim of comparing conventional fractionation (2.0 Gy per day, total 68 Gy during 7 weeks) and accelerated fractionation (1.1 + 2.0 Gy per day, total 68 Gy during 4.5 weeks). Seven hundred and fifty patients were randomized and 712 patients were followed from the start of RT in the present nutritional study. RESULTS: The patients had a weight loss of 11.3% (+/- 8.6%) during the acute phase (start of RT up to five months after the termination of RT). No difference in weight loss was seen between the two RT fractionation schedules (p = 0.839). Three factors were significantly predictive for weight loss during the acute phase, i.e. tumor site, overweight/obesity or lack of tube feeding at the start of RT. Moreover, the nadir point of weight loss occurred at five months after the termination of RT. CONCLUSION: The results of the present study showed no difference in weight loss between the two RT fractionation schedules and also highlight that weight loss in SCCHN is a multifactorial problem. Moreover, the nadir of weight loss occurred at five months after the termination of treatment which calls for more intense nutritional interventions during the period after treatment.	4
23253951	Shared care in the follow-up of early-stage melanoma: a qualitative study of Australian melanoma clinicians' perspectives and models of care.	BACKGROUND: Patients with early stage melanoma have high survival rates but require long-term follow-up to detect recurrences and/or new primary tumours. Shared care between melanoma specialists and general practitioners is an increasingly important approach to meeting the needs of a growing population of melanoma survivors. METHODS: In-depth qualitative study based on semi-structured interviews with 16 clinicians (surgical oncologists, dermatologists and melanoma unit GPs) who conduct post-treatment follow-up at two of Australia's largest specialist referral melanoma treatment and diagnosis units. Interviews were recorded, transcribed and analysed to identify approaches to shared care in follow-up, variations in practice, and explanations of these. RESULTS: Melanoma unit clinicians utilised shared care in the follow-up of patients with early stage melanoma. Schedules were determined by patients' clinical risk profiles. Final arrangements for delivery of those schedules (by whom and where) were influenced by additional psychosocial, professional and organizational considerations. Four models of shared care were described: (a) surgical oncologist alternating with dermatologist (in-house or local to patient); (b) melanoma unit dermatologist and other local doctor (e.g. family physician); (c) surgical oncologist and local doctor; or (d) melanoma physician and local doctor. CONCLUSIONS: These models of shared care offer alternative solutions to managing the requirements for long-term follow-up of a growing number of patients with stage I/II melanoma, and warrant further comparative evaluation of outcomes in clinical trials, with detailed cost/benefit analyses.	4
23379355	Superficial and deep lymph node dissection for stage III cutaneous melanoma: clinical outcome and prognostic factors.	BACKGROUND: The aims of this retrospective analysis were to evaluate the effect of combined superficial and deep groin dissection on disease-free and melanoma-specific survival, and to identify the most important factors for predicting the involvement of deep nodes according to clinically or microscopically detected nodal metastases. METHODS: Between January 1996 and December 2005, 133 consecutive patients with groin lymph node metastases underwent superficial and deep dissection at the National Cancer Institute, Naples. Lymph node involvement was clinically evident in 84 patients and detected by sentinel node biopsy in 49 cases. RESULTS: The 5-year disease-free survival was significantly better for patients with superficial lymph node metastases than for patients with involvement of both superficial and deep lymph nodes (34.9% vs. 19.0%; P = 0.001). The 5-year melanoma-specific survival was also significantly better for patients with superficial node metastases only (55.6% vs. 33.3%; P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Metastasis in the deep nodes is the strongest predictor of both disease-free and melanoma-specific survival. Deep groin dissection should be considered for all patients with groin clinical nodal involvement, but might be spared in patients with a positive sentinel node. Prospective studies will clarify the issue further.	3a
17308271	Double-blinded randomized study of high-dose calcitriol plus docetaxel compared with placebo plus docetaxel in androgen-independent prostate cancer: a report from the ASCENT Investigators.	PURPOSE: To compare the safety and activity of DN-101, a new high-dose oral formulation of calcitriol designed for cancer therapy, and docetaxel with placebo and docetaxel. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with progressive metastatic androgen-independent prostate cancer and adequate organ function received weekly docetaxel 36 mg/m2 intravenously for 3 weeks of a 4-week cycle combined with either 45 microg DN-101 or placebo taken orally 1 day before docetaxel. The primary end point was prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response within 6 months of enrollment, defined as a 50% reduction confirmed at least 4 weeks later. RESULTS: Two hundred fifty patients were randomly assigned. Baseline characteristics were similar in both arms. Within 6 months, PSA responses were seen in 58% in DN-101 patients and 49% in placebo patients (P = .16). Overall, PSA response rates were 63% (DN-101) and 52% (placebo), P = .07. Patients in the DN-101 group had a hazard ratio for death of 0.67 (P = .04) in a multivariate analysis that included baseline hemoglobin and performance status. Median survival has not been reached for the DN-101 arm and is estimated to be 24.5 months using the hazard ratio, compared with 16.4 months for placebo. Grade 3/4 adverse events occurred in 58% of DN-101 patients and in 70% of placebo-treated patients (P = .07). Most common grade 3/4 toxicities for DN-101 versus placebo were neutropenia (10% v 8%), fatigue (8% v 16%), infection (8% v 13%), and hyperglycemia (6% v 12%). CONCLUSION: This study suggests that DN-101 treatment was associated with improved survival, but this will require confirmation because survival was not a primary end point. The addition of weekly DN-101 did not increase the toxicity of weekly docetaxel.	1b
19176454	Phase 3 randomized trial on larynx preservation comparing sequential vs alternating chemotherapy and radiotherapy.	BACKGROUND: Both induction chemotherapy followed by irradiation and concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy have been reported as valuable alternatives to total laryngectomy in patients with advanced larynx or hypopharynx cancer. We report results of the randomized phase 3 trial 24954 from the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer. METHODS: Patients with resectable advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx (tumor stage T3-T4) or hypopharynx (T2-T4), with regional lymph nodes in the neck staged as N0-N2 and with no metastasis, were randomly assigned to treatment in the sequential (or control) or the alternating (or experimental) arm. In the sequential arm, patients with a 50% or more reduction in primary tumor size after two cycles of cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil received another two cycles, followed by radiotherapy (70 Gy total). In the alternating arm, a total of four cycles of cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (in weeks 1, 4, 7, and 10) were alternated with radiotherapy with 20 Gy during the three 2-week intervals between chemotherapy cycles (60 Gy total). All nonresponders underwent salvage surgery and postoperative radiotherapy. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to obtain time-to-event data. RESULTS: The 450 patients were randomly assigned to treatment (224 to the sequential arm and 226 to the alternating arm). Median follow-up was 6.5 years. Survival with a functional larynx was similar in sequential and alternating arms (hazard ratio of death and/or event = 0.85, 95% confidence interval = 0.68 to 1.06), as were median overall survival (4.4 and 5.1 years, respectively) and median progression-free interval (3.0 and 3.1 years, respectively). Grade 3 or 4 mucositis occurred in 64 (32%) of the 200 patients in the sequential arm who received radiotherapy and in 47 (21%) of the 220 patients in the alternating arm. Late severe edema and/or fibrosis was observed in 32 (16%) patients in the sequential arm and in 25 (11%) in the alternating arm. CONCLUSIONS: Larynx preservation, progression-free interval, and overall survival were similar in both arms, as were acute and late toxic effects.	1b
19671877	A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase II study comparing the tolerability and efficacy of ipilimumab administered with or without prophylactic budesonide in patients with unresectable stage III or IV melanoma.	PURPOSE: Diarrhea (with or without colitis) is an immune-related adverse event (irAE) associated with ipilimumab. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, multinational phase II trial was conducted to determine whether prophylactic budesonide (Entocort EC), a nonabsorbed oral steroid, reduced the rate of grade >or=2 diarrhea in ipilimumab-treated patients with advanced melanoma. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Previously treated and treatment-naive patients (N = 115) with unresectable stage III or IV melanoma received open-label ipilimumab (10 mg/kg every 3 weeks for four doses) with daily blinded budesonide (group A) or placebo (group B) through week 16. The first scheduled tumor evaluation was at week 12; eligible patients received maintenance treatment starting at week 24. Diarrhea was assessed using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) 3.0. Patients kept a diary describing their bowel habits. RESULTS: Budesonide did not affect the rate of grade >or=2 diarrhea, which occurred in 32.7% and 35.0% of patients in groups A and B, respectively. There were no bowel perforations or treatment-related deaths. Best overall response rates were 12.1% in group A and 15.8% in group B, with a median overall survival of 17.7 and 19.3 months, respectively. Within each group, the disease control rate was higher in patients with grade 3 to 4 irAEs than in patients with grade 0 to 2 irAEs, although many patients with grade 1 to 2 irAEs experienced clinical benefit. Novel patterns of response to ipilimumab were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Ipilimumab shows activity in advanced melanoma, with encouraging survival and manageable adverse events. Budesonide should not be used prophylactically for grade >or=2 diarrhea associated with ipilimumab therapy.	1b
15311729	Computerised tomography vs. pathological staging of laryngeal cancer: a 6-year completed audit cycle.	The aim of this audit was to examine the accuracy of computerised tomography (CT) staging of advanced laryngeal tumours. CT staging was evaluated against the T staging of laryngeal tumours as determined by pathological examination. Data from 38 patients, between 1996 and 2000 with laryngeal squamous cell cancer that fulfilled the audit criteria, were collected and compared. Subjects had to have a pre-operative CT scan of the larynx and a total laryngectomy specimen for pathological staging. The audit demonstrated that 45% of the patients were over staged and 10% were under staged using CT criteria as compared to pathological staging. Fourteen patients had been erroneously up staged to T4 on the basis of laryngeal cartilage invasion as judged by the radiological sign of cartilage sclerosis. While this radiological sign is used as a marker of neoplastic invasion in the literature, it was found to have a low sensitivity of 62% and low specificity of 42% in this study. Arytenoid cartilage sclerosis in isolation was no longer used as a radiological sign of neoplastic cartilage invasion. Following the change in practice, the CT staging of laryngeal cancer was re-evaluated in a second audit cycle. Correct CT staging of the tumour improved from 45 to 71%. Arytenoid cartilage sclerosis is no longer used as a sole CT criterion for predicting neoplastic cartilage invasion at our institution.	4
17943778	Self-management education for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.	BACKGROUND: There is great interest in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and the associated large burden of disease. COPD is characterised by frequent day by day fluctuations, and repetitive clinical exacerbations are typical. Self-management is a term applied to educational programmes aimed at teaching skills needed to carry out medical regimens specific to the disease, guide health behaviour change, and provide emotional support for patients to control their disease and live functional lives. In COPD, the value of self-management education is not yet clear. The first Cochrane review about self-management was published in 2003. It was intended to shed light on the effectiveness of self-management programmes in COPD and the relative efficacy of their constitutive elements. No conclusions about the effectiveness of self-management could be drawn because of the large variation in outcome measures used in the limited number of included studies. This article describes the first update of this review. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this review was to assess the settings, methods and efficacy of COPD self-management education programmes on health outcomes and use of health care services. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Airways Group trial register, MEDLINE (January 1985 to January 2006), reference lists, and abstracts of medical conferences. SELECTION CRITERIA: Controlled trials (randomised and non-randomised) of self-management education in patients with COPD. Studies focusing mainly on pulmonary rehabilitation and studies without usual care as a control group were excluded. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two reviewers independently assessed study quality and extracted data. Investigators were contacted for additional information. MAIN RESULTS: The reviewers included 15 group comparisons drawn from 14 trials. They assessed a broad-spectrum of interventions and health outcomes with different follow-up times. Meta-analyses could often not appropriately be performed because of heterogeneity among studies. The studies showed a significant reduction in the probability of at least one hospital admission among patients receiving self-management education compared to those receiving usual care (OR 0.64; 95% CI (0.47 to 0.89)). This translates into a one year NNT ranging from 10 (6 to 35) for patients with a 51% risk of exacerbation, to an NNT of 24 (16 to 80) for patients with a 13% risk of exacerbation. On the disease specific SGRQ, differences reached statistical significance at the 5% level on the total score (WMD -2.58; 95% CI (-5.14 to -0.02)) and impact domain (WMD -2.83; 95% CI (-5.65 to -0.02)), but these difference did not reach the clinically relevant improvement of 4 points. A small but significant reduction was detected in dyspnoea measured with the BORG-scale (WMD -0.53; 95% CI (-0.96 to -0.10)). No significant effects were found either in number of exacerbations, emergency department visits, lung function, exercise capacity, and days lost from work. Inconclusive results were observed in doctor and nurse visits, on symptoms other than dyspnoea, the use of courses of oral corticosteroids and antibiotics, and the use of rescue medication. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: It is likely that self-management education is associated with a reduction in hospital admissions with no indications for detrimental effects in other outcome parameters. This would in itself already be enough reason for recommending self-management education in COPD. However, because of heterogeneity in interventions, study populations, follow-up time, and outcome measures, data are still insufficient to formulate clear recommendations regarding the form and contents of self-management education programmes in COPD. There is an evident need for more large RCTs with a long-term follow-up, before more conclusions can be drawn.	1a
8400346	Subcutaneous octreotide versus oral loperamide in the treatment of diarrhea following chemotherapy.	Forty patients with chemotherapy-related diarrhea were randomized to receive (i) octreotide 0.5 mg three times per day s.c. or (ii) loperamide 4 mg three times per day p.o. until complete remission of diarrhea was achieved. In the octreotide group 80% of patients showed complete resolution of loose bowel movements within 4 days of therapy, while in the loperamide group this goal was obtained in only 30% of cases (p < 0.001). If after 4 days no benefit was seen, patients were considered to have failed antidiarrheal therapy. Failure was recorded in only one case (5%) treated with s.c. octreotide and in five patients (25%) who received loperamide. The mean duration of antidiarrheal therapy necessary to achieve remission was 3.4 days in the octreotide group and 6.1 days in the loperamide group (p < 0.001). Treatment with octreotide was very well tolerated with mild abdominal pain in 15% of cases and pain in the injection site in 15% of patients. Subcutaneous octreotide is highly effective in the management of chemotherapy-related diarrhea in cancer patients.	2b
17398060	Tumour characteristics predictive of survival following resection for ductal adenocarcinoma of the head of pancreas.	AIMS: We have maintained a highly conservative policy in selecting patients with carcinoma of the head of pancreas for resection. This has been based on tumour size, evidence of lymph node involvement or local invasion outside of the gland at laparotomy, laparoscopy or CT imaging. This study investigated our survival rates following pancreatic resection and examined clinicopathological predictors of survival. METHODS: Sixty-two consecutive patients undergoing pancreatic resections for malignancy were identified from 1999 onwards. Thirty-three underwent resection for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and were included in our analysis, the remainder included resections for ampullary adenocarcinoma (n=20) or other malignancies (n=9). Patient, tumour and operative characteristics were analysed to assess predictors of survival following resection (Kaplan-Meier survival curves). RESULTS: Median survival following resection for ductal pancreatic adenocarcinoma was 54 months (ampullary adenocarcinomas achieved a median survival of 62 months) and thirty-day mortality was 2.7% (n=1). Survival was not associated with any demographic or intraoperative factors, such as blood loss, operative duration or anaesthetic technique. Survival curves were significantly worse when perineural or vascular invasion was evident histologically (p=0.023 and 0.0023 respectively). Patients with positive lymph nodes had a significantly shorter survival (p=0.0030) especially when lymph node status was expressed as a percentage of total lymph node yield. If more than 20% of retrieved lymph nodes were positive for tumour, this was a clear predictor of survival (p<0.0001). A positive resection margin was also associated with shortened survival (p=0.0291). CONCLUSION: Despite the advances made in the management of pancreatic cancer, tumour biology still dictates long-term survival. A highly selective surgical approach to the management of these patients results in good long-term survival.	4
4060247	The importance of a home care program for patients with advanced cancer pain.	At the Pain Clinic of the National Cancer Institute of Milan, a special Home Care Program has been set up to assist advanced cancer patients with pain and their families during their remaining survival. The Home Care Unit comprises a team of physician, nurse clinicians, psychologists and many volunteers who are active both in the hospital and at the patient's home. This entire operation provides a continuous relationship between the family, the patient and the Home Care Unit. This Home Care Program, which is one of a kind with other forms of treatment for advanced cancer patients (i.e. hospices), has produced interesting results. Out of a sample group of 50 patients, 33 were monitored at home by the Home Care Unit while 17 had their families to do the monitoring. Over a six-week period the following results were reported: a) Improvement of psycho-emotional factors such as anxiety, weakness and mood for both patients and their families who entered the Home Care Program. b) The Quality of Life Index remained unchanged for the sample group that entered the Home Care Program whereas it deteriorated for patients monitored by their families. c) A decrease in the Integrated Pain Score for both groups; however, results showed a statistically significant difference in favor of patients on the Home Care Program. d) The Performance Status decreased by very little over the study period, and there was little difference between the two groups. These results confirm the need for a Home Care Program which must go hand in hand with the Pain Clinic as an effective way to control Total Pain.	1b
15134983	Is the efficacy of hormonal therapy affected by lymph node status? data from the bicalutamide (Casodex) Early Prostate Cancer program.	OBJECTIVES: To report an exploratory subgroup analysis assessing the extent to which the overall benefit found in the Early Prostate Cancer program is dependent on lymph node status at randomization. The program is ongoing, and the overall survival data are immature. The first combined analysis of the bicalutamide (Casodex) Early Prostate Cancer program at 3 years' median follow-up showed that bicalutamide, 150 mg once daily, plus standard care (radical prostatectomy, radiotherapy, or watchful waiting), significantly reduced the risk of objective progression and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) doubling in patients with localized/locally advanced prostate cancer. METHODS: Men (n = 8113) with localized/locally advanced disease received bicalutamide 150 mg or placebo once daily, plus standard care. The time to event data (objective progression, PSA doubling) was analyzed by lymph node status at randomization. RESULTS: Compared with standard care alone, bicalutamide significantly reduced the risk of objective progression, irrespective of lymph node status, with the most pronounced reduction in patients with N+ (hazard ratio [HR] 0.29; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.15 to 0.56) compared with those with N0 (HR 0.59; 95% CI 0.48 to 0.73) and Nx (HR 0.60; 95% CI 0.50 to 0.72) disease. The largest decrease in risk of PSA doubling with bicalutamide was observed in N+ disease (HR 0.16; 95% CI 0.09 to 0.29), with significantly reduced risks seen in N0 (HR 0.45; 95% CI 0.40 to 0.51) and Nx (HR 0.38; 95% CI 0.33 to 0.44) disease. CONCLUSIONS: The greatest reduction in the risk of objective progression and PSA doubling with bicalutamide was seen in patients with N+ disease. However, bicalutamide also provided a statistically significant benefit in those with N0 and Nx disease.	1b
20006921	A phase Ib/IIa trial to evaluate the CCK2 receptor antagonist Z-360 in combination with gemcitabine in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer.	AIM: To evaluate the combination of the gastrin antagonist Z-360 and gemcitabine for advanced pancreatic cancer. METHODS: Previously untreated patients with PC were randomly allocated to Z-360 120 mg, 240 mg or placebo. Z-360/placebo was given on day -3 and gemcitabine 1000 mg/m(2) commenced on day 1 followed by Z-360 on day 2. Thereafter Z-360/placebo was given twice daily concurrently with standard dose of gemcitabine. Pharmacokinetics for both drugs was measured alone and in combination. Toxicity, response and quality of life were also recorded. RESULTS: Thirty-three patients with a median age of 62 years were randomised of which six had locally advanced disease and 26 had metastatic disease. Analysis of the area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC), the maximum observed concentration (Cmax(obs)) and the time of the maximum observed concentration (Tmax(obs)) for Z-360, gemcitabine and 2,2-difluorodeoxyuridine (dFdU), could not exclude an effect on the systemic exposure to Z-360, gemcitabine and dFdU when co-administration of Z-360 and gemcitabine was compared with single agent administration. The most commonly reported adverse events were nausea, abdominal pain, vomiting and fatigue. At the end of the study, 62.5%, 25% and 60% had stable disease in the 120 mg, 240 mg and placebo group, respectively. A higher proportion of patients in Z-360 groups reported improvement in pain. CONCLUSIONS: Z-360 is safe and well tolerated when combined with gemcitabine. A Phase III trial is needed to determine whether the combination of Z-360 and gemcitabine is superior to gemcitabine alone in advanced PC.	1b
23733756	Randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial of acetyl-L-carnitine for the prevention of taxane-induced neuropathy in women undergoing adjuvant breast cancer therapy.	PURPOSE: Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is common and leads to suboptimal treatment. Acetyl-L-carnitine (ALC) is a natural compound involved in neuronal protection. Studies have suggested ALC may be effective for the prevention and treatment of CIPN. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A 24-week randomized double-blind trial comparing ALC (3,000 mg per day) with placebo in women undergoing adjuvant taxane-based chemotherapy was conducted. The primary objective was to determine if ALC prevents CIPN as measured by the 11-item neurotoxicity (NTX) component of the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT) -Taxane scale at 12 weeks. Secondary objectives included changes in 24-week end points, functional status (FACT-Trial Outcome Index [TOI]), fatigue (Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy [FACIT] -Fatigue), and NTX grade. RESULTS: A total of 409 patients were evaluable (208 received ALC; 201, placebo). In a multivariate linear regression, week-12 scores were 0.9 points lower (more CIPN) with ALC than placebo (95% CI, -2.2 to 0.4; P = .17), whereas week-24 scores were 1.8 points lower with ALC (95% CI, -3.2 to -0.4; P = .01). Patients receiving ALC were more likely to have a > 5-point decrease in FACT-NTX scores (38% v 28%; P = .05), and FACT-TOI scores were 3.5 points lower with ALC (P = .03). Grade 3 to 4 neurotoxicity was more frequent in the ALC arm (eight v one). No differences between arms were observed for FACIT-Fatigue or other toxicities. Serum carnitine level increased with ALC but remained stable with placebo. CONCLUSION: There was no evidence that ALC affected CIPN at 12 weeks; however, ALC significantly increased CIPN by 24 weeks. This is the first study to our knowledge showing that a nutritional supplement increased CIPN. Patients should be discouraged from using supplements without proven efficacy.	1b
18830132	Chemoablation of metastatic melanoma using intralesional Rose Bengal.	To study the effects of intralesional Rose Bengal for chemoablation of metastatic melanoma. Twenty-six target lesions in 11 patients with locoregionally recurrent disease were injected with the agent PV-10 (10% w/v Rose Bengal in saline) at a dose of 0.5 ml/cc lesion volume. An additional 28 untreated lesions were observed for potential bystander effect. The treatment was well tolerated and an objective response was observed in 12 target lesions, with an additional seven lesions remaining static over at least 12 weeks of observation. In this dose-evaluation study, response rate was dose dependent, increasing to 69% after higher dose injections. Nontarget lesions exhibited a 27% objective response rate that increased to 44% in patients exhibiting a positive response of target lesions. These findings indicate that intralesional Rose Bengal is nontoxic and could benefit patients with metastatic melanoma.	4
10812390	[Prevention of radiation-induced diarrhea by smectite. Results of a double-blind randomized, placebo-controlled multicenter study].	PURPOSE: Diarrhea and abdominal pain are well-known side effects abdominal or pelvic of radiation therapy that may lead to interruption of treatment in serious cases. In recent trials the silicate smectite has proven a promising drug in the prophylaxis of these adverse events. The presented trial aimed at the verification of earlier studies and the evaluation of a dose-effect relationship. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between April 1994 and May 1995, a total of 176 patients obtaining radiotherapy of the pelvis or the abdomen were evaluated in a double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled investigation regarding the prophylactic effect of smectite (= Colina) against radiotherapy-induced diarrhea. During the whole period of radiotherapy 85 patients obtained 2 x 6 g smectite daily and 91 patients received 2 x 6 g placebo. The primary end point of the analysis was the time to the first appearance of diarrhea (> or = 3 pappy stools). RESULTS: All 176 patients were evaluated according to an intent-to-treat analysis. There was no significant difference between the prophylactic effects of smectite and placebo. For an explorative post-hoc analysis the total study group was split up into 2 subgroups, one with an irradiated small bowel volume < or = 837.5 ml, the other with a small bowel volume > 837.5 ml (median); the analysis indicated that the first subgroup showed a benefit for the smectite-treated patients in contrast to the placebo treatment (32 vs. 18 calendar days to the first appearance of diarrhea). This benefit was statistically not significant. CONCLUSION: Prophylactic application of smectite during irradiation of the pelvis and the abdomen can delay the development of radiotherapy-induced diarrhea, a statistical significance could not be verified neither in the total study group nor in the post-hoc subgroup analysis.	1b
8357595	Clinical underestimation of laryngeal cancer. Predictive indicators.	OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the accuracy of clinical staging of advanced laryngeal cancer and to morphologically analyze the underestimated cases. DESIGN: We conducted a retrospective histopathologic study of larynges from patients who had had total laryngectomy and were seen over a 21-year period. SETTING: Academic tertiary referral medical center. PARTICIPANTS: Forty-one patients had clinically staged T3 laryngeal cancer and 16 patients had T4 cancer. INTERVENTION: Patients all underwent wide-field total laryngectomy. All larynges were processed as whole-organ serial sections in the coronal plane. OUTCOME MEASURE: The incidence of clinically underestimated laryngeal cancer. During this investigation, it became obvious that predictive indicators of thyroid cartilage involvement could be established. RESULTS: Clinical underestimation had been made in approximately 50% of all T3 laryngeal cancer cases. The extent of the cartilage involvement in the underestimated group was characterized by microinvasion without penetration; approximately 90% of the cartilage involvement affected the thyroid notch and adjacent area. We established five objective indicators of thyroid cartilage involvement: (1) extensive cartilage ossification (risk for cartilage involvement, 73%); (2) glottic fixation (54%); (3) transglottic cancer (74%); (4) tumor length longer than the entire vocal fold length or longer than 2 cm (66%); and (5) extensive involvement of the anterior commissure (67%). CONCLUSIONS: Clinical underestimation of T4 laryngeal cancer was high because thyroid cartilage involvement was not accurately diagnosed. We believe our indicators of thyroid cartilage involvement will provide objective guidelines for laryngeal cancer staging and will contribute to more reliable clinical cancer-staging decisions.	4
19723142	Classification of R1 resections for pancreatic cancer: the prognostic relevance of tumour involvement within 1 mm of a resection margin.	AIMS: The current Royal College of Pathologists guidelines for pancreatoduodenectomy specimen reporting recommend that microscopic evidence of tumour within 1 mm of a resection margin (RM) should be classified as R1. No clinical evidence exists to justify this classification. The aim of this study was to identify the proportion of pancreatoduodenectomy specimens in which 'equivocal' RMs are present (tumour involvement within 1 mm of, but not directly reaching, one or more resection margins) and whether the survival of these patients was similar to that of patients with 'unequivocal' RM involvement. METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients with histologically confirmed pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma undergoing pancreatoduodenectomy between 1997 and 2007 (n = 163) were identified from a prospective database. One hundred and twenty-eight cases (79%) were classified as R1. Of these, 57 (45% of all R1 cases) were based on 'equivocal' margin involvement. There was no significant difference in overall survival between equivocal and unequivocal R1 resections (log rank, P = 0.102). All R1 resections had a poorer survival on univariate (log rank, P = 0.013), but not multivariate, analysis (Cox, P = 0.132). CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that cases with microscopic tumour involvement within 1 mm of a resection margin should be considered synonymous with incomplete excision for resected pancreatic cancer.	2b
20607257	Vascular reconstruction during pancreatoduodenectomy for ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreas improves resectability but does not achieve cure.	OBJECTIVE: Combined vascular and pancreatic resection improves long-term survival of patients suffering from ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreatic head. This study was designed to compare the results of surgical resection in patients with pancreatic cancer with or without vascular resection. Late 10-year disease-free survival was considered as an indicator of patients' disease cure. METHODS: A total of 149 consecutive patients have undergone pancreatoduodenectomy without vascular resection (group 1: 82 patients), with isolated venous resection (group B: 67 patients), or with arterial and/or venous resection (group C: 8 patients). RESULTS: The duration of surgery and blood losses were significantly more important in groups B and C compared with group A; however, postoperative morbidity and mortality rates were similar. R1 resection was significantly more frequent in groups B (42%) and C (50%) compared with group A (13%; p = 0.0002), but there were more advanced tumors in these groups, as demonstrated by a lower Karnowsky index, higher Ca 19-9 plasmatic level, greater tumor size, more advanced stage in the AJCC classification, and more tumor location in the uncinate process of the pancreas. Ten-year overall and disease-free survivals were significantly better in group A (19 and 20%) compared with group B (2.8 and 0%) and group C (0% and 0%). Multivariate analysis proved vascular resection and metastatic nodal status as being independent predictive factors of disease-free survival. CONCLUSIONS: Vascular resection combined to pancreatoduodenectomy for pancreatic cancer increases local resectability without increasing mortality and morbidity rates but does not improve patients' disease cure rate.	2b
26034866	Ipilimumab-associated Hepatitis: Clinicopathologic Characterization in a Series of 11 Cases.	Ipilimumab is a monoclonal antibody that inhibits the CTLA4 receptor on cytotoxic T lymphocytes, resulting in immune-mediated tumor cell death. Ipilimumab is most often used in the treatment of metastatic melanoma, and rarely liver toxicity necessitating cessation of treatment occurs. The aim of this study was to characterize the histologic features and clinical course of ipilimumab-associated hepatitis. Eleven patients with clinical suspicion of ipilimumab-induced hepatitis, due to the development of abnormal liver function tests (LFTs) while receiving treatment, and who underwent liver biopsy, were identified over a 6-year period. Ten patients were male and 1 female (median age 58 y), and all received 1 to 4 doses of ipilimumab. None had known preexisting liver disease. Two patients were obese, and another had a history of alcohol abuse. Viral and autoimmune serologies were negative in all patients except 1 who had a mildly elevated ANA titer. Nine biopsies showed active hepatitis with 2 distinct histologic patterns: panlobular hepatitis in 6 cases and zone 3 hepatitis in 3. The inflammatory infiltrate was similar in composition in both patterns, composed predominantly of CD8+ T lymphocytes, admixed histiocytes, scattered plasma cells, and eosinophils. Prominent histiocytic sinusoidal infiltrates were present in 7 cases and frequently formed loose histiocytic aggregates. Central vein endothelialitis was present in 8 cases. Patients in this group tended to have markedly elevated ALT, AST, and total bilirubin. Two cases did not fit into the above 2 histologic groups: 1 showed portal inflammation with cholangitis, and the other showed morphologic features indistinguishable from nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Discontinuation of ipilimumab and administration of immunosuppressives resulted in resolution or marked improvement of LFTs in all patients within 3 months of presentation. Ipilimumab may potentially unmask previously subclinical liver disease, for example, fatty liver disease, and the diagnosis of ipilimumab-induced liver injury may only be recognized with certainty after cessation of the drug leads to normalization of LFTs. Overall, ipilimumab-associated hepatitis most often presents with a panlobular active hepatitis that resembles autoimmune hepatitis. Prominent sinusoidal histiocytic infiltrates and central vein damage with endothelialitis may be helpful histologic clues to the diagnosis of ipilimumab-associated hepatitis.	4
12913699	Long-term followup of a randomized trial of 0 versus 3 months of neoadjuvant androgen ablation before radical prostatectomy.	PURPOSE: In 1992 we initiated a national randomized prospective trial of 3 months of cyproterone acetate before radical prostatectomy compared to prostatectomy alone. Initial results indicated a 50% decrease in the rate of positive surgical margins. This decrease did not translate into a difference in prostate specific antigen (PSA) progression at 3 years. This report is on the long-term outcome (median followup 6 years) of this cohort. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective, randomized, open label trial compared 100 mg cyproterone acetate 3 times daily for 3 months before surgery to surgery alone. Randomization occurred between January 1993 and April 1994. Patients were stratified according to clinical stage, baseline serum PSA and Gleason sum. A total of 213 patients were accrued. Biochemical progression was defined as 2 consecutive detectable PSAs (greater than 0.2 ng/ml) at least 4 weeks apart, re-treatment or death from prostate cancer. RESULTS: A total of 34 (33.6%) patients undergoing surgery only and 42 (37.5%) patients given neoadjuvant hormone therapy (NHT) had biochemical recurrence during the median followup of 6 years. Despite the significant pathological down staging in this study, there was no significant difference in number of patients with no evidence of biochemical disease (bNED) survival (p = 0.732). A bNED survival benefit favoring NHT was seen in men with a baseline PSA greater than 20 (p = 0.015). CONCLUSIONS: After 6 years of followup there was no overall benefit with 3 months of NHT. Improved bNED survival was seen in the highest risk PSA group (PSA greater than 20). The possibility that high risk patients may benefit from NHT warrants further investigation.	1a
28176423	Effects of foot massage applied in two different methods on symptom control in colorectal cancer patients: Randomised control trial.	This randomized controlled clinical study aimed to determine the effect of 2 foot massage methods on symptom control in people with colorectal cancer who received chemoradiotherapy. Data were collected between June 16, 2015, and February 10, 2016, in the Department of Radiation Oncology of an oncology training and research hospital. The sample comprised 60 participants. Data were collected using an introductory information form, common terminology criteria for adverse events and European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaires C30 and CR29. Participants were randomly allocated to 3 groups: classical foot massage, reflexology, and standard care control. The classical massage group received foot massage using classical massage techniques, and the reflexology group received foot reflexology focusing on symptom-oriented reflexes twice a week during a 5-week chemoradiotherapy treatment schedule. The control group received neither classical massage nor reflexology. All patients were provided with the same clinic routine care. The classical massage was effective in reducing pain level and distension incidence while foot reflexology was effective in reducing pain and fatigue level, lowering incidence of distension and urinary frequency and improving life quality.	2b
15679006	Randomized trial of paroxetine in end-stage COPD.	BACKGROUND: Although the underlying pathology is initially confined to the lungs, the associated emotional responses to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) contribute greatly to the resulting morbidity. The objective of this study was to examine the effect of an antidepressant drug on disease-specific quality of life in patients with end-stage COPD who present significant depressive symptoms. METHODS: We conducted a 12-week, randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial of Paroxetine in which quality of life measured by the Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire (CRQ), an evaluative COPD-specific quality-of-life questionnaire, was the primary outcome. RESULTS: 23 patients were randomized and 15 completed the trial (8 on Paroxetine; 7 on placebo). In the per-protocol analysis, we observed statistically and clinically significant improvements favoring the active treatment in 2 of the 4 domains of the CRQ: emotional function (adjusted mean difference: 1.1; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.0 - 2.2) and mastery (difference: 1.1; CI: 0.4 - 1.8). Dyspnea and fatigue improved, but to an extent that did not reach statistical significance. In the intention-to-treat analysis, none of the differences in CRQ scores was significant. Paroxetine was not associated to any worsening of respiratory symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this small randomized trial indicated that patients with end-stage COPD may benefit from antidepressant drug therapy when significant depressive symptoms are present. This study underlined the difficulties in conducting experimental studies in frail and elderly patients with COPD.	1a
18559026	A systematic review and meta-analysis of the role of positron emission tomography in the follow up of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma following radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy.	OBJECTIVES: This review examines the effectiveness of positron emission tomography (PET) in the detection of recurrent or persistent head and neck squamous cell carcinoma after radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy. DESIGN: A systematic review and meta-analysis of trials of PET for detecting residual/recurrent head and neck squamous cell carcinoma treated by radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy. Trials were quality assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies tool for assessing diagnostic accuracy studies. Quantitative data were extracted and a bivariate random effects model used to calculate pooled sensitivity and specificity. SETTING: Tertiary referral head and neck centre. PARTICIPANTS: Prospective and retrospective studies, excluding reviews, which included patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma who had fluorodeoxyglucose PET in the post-treatment phase following primary treatment by radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy. MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES: Quality assessment, sensitivity, specificity, false positive rates, false negative rates, positive and negative predictive values. RESULTS: Twenty-seven of 1871 identified studies were eligible for inclusion. The pooled sensitivity and specificity of PET for detecting residual or recurrent head and neck squamous cell carcinoma were 94% [95% confidence interval (CI), 87-97%] and 82% (95% CI, 76-86%) respectively. Positive and negative predictive values were 75% (95% CI, 68-82%), and 95% (95% CI, 92-97%) respectively. Sensitivity was greater for scans performed 10 weeks or more after treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Positron emission tomography is highly accurate in this role. However it is less sensitive early after treatment and has poor anatomical detail. PET may reduce the requirement for check endoscopies and planned neck dissections. A protocol for its use in post-treatment surveillance is proposed.	2a
28827927	Effect of Yoga on Sleep Quality and Neuroendocrine Immune Response in Metastatic Breast Cancer Patients.	"BACKGROUND: Studies have shown that distress and accompanying neuroendocrine stress responses as important predictor of survival in advanced breast cancer patients. Some psychotherapeutic intervention studies have shown have modulation of neuroendocrine-immune responses in advanced breast cancer patients. In this study, we evaluate the effects of yoga on perceived stress, sleep, diurnal cortisol, and natural killer (NK) cell counts in patients with metastatic cancer. METHODS: In this study, 91 patients with metastatic breast cancer who satisfied selection criteria and consented to participate were recruited and randomized to receive ""integrated yoga based stress reduction program"" (n = 45) or standard ""education and supportive therapy sessions"" (n = 46) over a 3 month period. Psychometric assessments for sleep quality were done before and after intervention. Blood draws for NK cell counts were collected before and after the intervention. Saliva samples were collected for three consecutive days before and after intervention. Data were analyzed using the analysis of covariance on postmeasures using respective baseline measure as a covariate. RESULTS: There was a significant decrease in scales of symptom distress (P < 0.001), sleep parameters (P = 0.02), and improvement in quality of sleep (P = 0.001) and Insomnia Rating Scale sleep score (P = 0.001) following intervention. There was a decrease in morning waking cortisol in yoga group (P = 0.003) alone following intervention. There was a significant improvement in NK cell percent (P = 0.03) following intervention in yoga group compared to control group. CONCLUSION: The results suggest modulation of neuroendocrine responses and improvement in sleep in patients with advanced breast cancer following yoga intervention."	2b
17171496	Prognostic implication of para-aortic lymph node metastasis in resectable pancreatic cancer.	BACKGROUND: The survival curve of patients who undergo surgical resection of pancreatic cancer displays a steep decline within 1 year and a relatively slow decline thereafter. The patients with a short survival time may have identifiable clinicopathologic factors that lead to rapid relapse. STUDY DESIGN: We analyzed clinicopathologic factors in 133 patients who underwent margin-negative pancreatoduodenectomy with extended radical lymphadenectomy for invasive ductal carcinoma of the pancreas to detect factors that could be responsible for the short survival. RESULTS: Tumor size, invasion of the anterior pancreatic capsule, retroperitoneal invasion, portal venous invasion, major arterial invasion, and metastasis to the para-aortic lymph nodes were variables associated with survival time in univariate analysis. Metastasis to the para-aortic lymph nodes was the single independent factor with a significant association with mortality in multivariate analysis. Some 84% of the patients who had positive para-aortic lymph nodes died within 1 year, versus 46% of the patients with negative nodes. CONCLUSIONS: Although tumors that involve the para-aortic lymph nodes may technically be resectable, the expected postoperative survival time for most patients is less than 1 year. If para-aortic nodal metastasis is detected, alternative treatment strategies should be considered.	2b
30113073	Risk of endometrial cancer and endometrial hyperplasia with atypia in asymptomatic postmenopausal women with endometrial thickness >/=11 mm: A systematic review and meta-analysis.	"PURPOSE: To evaluate the risk of endometrial cancer and/or endometrial hyperplasia with atypia in asymptomatic postmenopausal women with endometrial thickness >/= 11 mm. METHODS: Systematic review of literature using database search (PubMed and Web of Science) of articles published between January 1990 and December 2016 evaluating the correlation between endometrial thickness as measured by transvaginal ultrasound (double layer) and histopathological findings in asymptomatic postmenopausal women, using the following terms: ""endometrial thickness,"" ""postmenopausal,"" ""postmenopause,"" and ""asymptomatic."" Inclusion criteria were prospective or retrospective studies of more than 150 cases that provided information on endometrial thickness and its correlation with histopathological data. Studies that included patients with hormone replacement therapy, tamoxifen, or aromatase inhibitors were excluded. The overall relative risk (RR) for EC/EHA was calculated, stratifying the patients into two groups according to endometrial thickness (<11 mm and >/=11 mm). Heterogeneity was assessed by calculating I(2) . RESULTS: The search identified 289 studies. After exclusions, nine articles that met all the inclusion criteria were included, comprising data from 4751 women. The prevalence of endometrial cancer and/or endometrial hyperplasia with atypia was 2.4%. The relative risk of endometrial cancer and/or endometrial hyperplasia with atypia in the >/=11 mm group was 2.59 (95% CI: 1.66-4.05). High heterogeneity was observed between studies (I(2) : 57.3%, P = .016). CONCLUSIONS: Overall the risk for EC/EHA was 2.6 times greater in women with ET >/=11 mm vs women with ET 5-10 mm, although there was significant heterogeneity in estimates across studies."	2a
12826636	Outpatient oral prednisone after emergency treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.	BACKGROUND: In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we studied the effectiveness of prednisone in reducing the risk of relapse after outpatient exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). METHODS: We enrolled 147 patients who were being discharged from the emergency department after an exacerbation of COPD and randomly assigned them to 10 days of treatment with 40 mg of oral prednisone once daily or identical-appearing placebo. All patients received oral antibiotics for 10 days, plus inhaled bronchodilators. The primary end point was relapse, defined as an unscheduled visit to a physician's office or a return to the emergency department because of worsening dyspnea, within 30 days after randomization. RESULTS: The overall rate of relapse at 30 days was lower in the prednisone group than in the placebo group (27 percent vs. 43 percent, P=0.05), and the time to relapse was prolonged in those taking prednisone (P=0.04). After 10 days of therapy, patients in the prednisone group had greater improvements in forced expiratory volume in one second than did patients in the placebo group (mean [+/-SD] increase from base line, 34+/-42 percent vs. 15+/-31 percent; P=0.007). Patients in the prednisone group also had significant improvements in dyspnea, as measured by the transitional dyspnea index (P=0.04) and by the dyspnea domain of the Chronic Respiratory Disease Index Questionnaire (P=0.02), but not in health-related quality of life (P=0.14). CONCLUSIONS: Outpatient treatment with oral prednisone offers a small advantage over placebo in treating patients who are discharged from the emergency department with an exacerbation of COPD.	1a
29732585	Diagnostic Performance of Transvaginal Ultrasound for Detecting Cervical Invasion In Women With Endometrial Carcinoma: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.	"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the role of transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) for diagnosing cervical invasion in the preoperative assessment of endometrial carcinoma. METHODS: A search for studies evaluating the role of TVUS for assessing cervical invasion in endometrial carcinoma from January 1990 to December 2016 was performed in the PubMed/MEDLINE, Web of Science, www.ClinicalTrials.gov, and www.who.int/trialsearchdatabases. The quality of the studies was evaluated by the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2. RESULTS: We identified 211 citations. Ultimately, 17 studies comprising 1751 women were included. The mean prevalence of cervical invasion was 16.3%. The risk of bias was high in 7 studies for the domains ""patient selection"" and ""index test,"" whereas it was considered low for the ""reference test"" domain. Overall, the pooled estimated sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio, and negative likelihood ratio of TVUS for detecting cervical invasion were 63% (95% confidence interval [CI], 51%-74%), 91% (95% CI, 87%-94%), 10.2 (95% CI, 5.7-18.3), and 0.38 (95% CI, 0.28-0.53), respectively. Heterogeneity was high for both sensitivity and specificity. CONCLUSIONS: Transvaginal ultrasound has acceptable diagnostic performance for detecting cervical invasion in women with endometrial carcinoma."	3a
16538410	Hepatic resection for metastatic melanoma: distinct patterns of recurrence and prognosis for ocular versus cutaneous disease.	BACKGROUND: Resection of melanoma metastatic to the liver remains controversial. We evaluated the efficacy of hepatic resection in patients with metastatic ocular and cutaneous melanoma and assessed factors that could affect survival after resection. METHODS: Forty patients with hepatic melanoma metastasis underwent resection at four major hepatobiliary centers. Clinicopathologic factors were evaluated with regard to recurrence and survival by using chi(2) and log-rank tests. RESULTS: The primary tumor was ocular in 16 patients and cutaneous in 24. The median disease-free interval from the time of primary tumor treatment to hepatic metastasis was the same for both groups (ocular, 62.9 months; cutaneous, 63.1 months; P = .94). Most patients underwent either an extended hepatic resection (37.5%) or hemihepatectomy (22.5%). Twenty-six patients (65%) received perioperative systemic therapy. Thirty (75.0%) of 40 patients developed tumor recurrence. The median time to recurrence after hepatic resection was 8.3 months (ocular, 8.8 months; cutaneous, 4.7 months; P = .3). Patients with primary ocular melanoma were more likely to experience recurrence within the liver (53.3% vs. 17.4%; P = .015), whereas patients with a cutaneous primary tumor more often developed extrahepatic involvement. The 5-year survival rate for patients with a primary ocular melanoma was 20.5%, whereas there were no 5-year survivors for patients with cutaneous melanoma (P = .03). CONCLUSIONS: Patterns of recurrence and prognosis after resection of hepatic melanoma metastasis differ depending on whether the primary melanoma is ocular or cutaneous. Resection should be performed as part of a multidisciplinary approach, because recurrence is common.	4
29105910	Mindfulness for palliative care patients. Systematic review.	BACKGROUND: Nineteen million adults worldwide are in need of palliative care. Of those who have access to it, 80% fail to receive an efficient management of symptoms. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness and safety of mindfulness meditation for palliative care patients. METHODS: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, PEDro, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Opengrey, ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO-ICTRP. No restriction of language, status or date of publication was applied. We considered randomised clinical trials (RCTs) comparing any mindfulness meditation scheme vs any comparator for palliative care. Cochrane Risk of Bias (Rob) Table was used for assessing methodological quality of RCTs. Screening, data extraction and methodological assessments were performed by two reviewers. Mean differences (MD) (confidence intervals of 95% (CI 95%)) were considered for estimating effect size. Quality of evidence was appraised by GRADE. RESULTS: Four RCTs, 234 participants, were included. All studies presented high risk of bias in at least one RoB table criteria. We assessed 4 comparisons, but only 2 studies showed statistically significant difference for at least one outcome. 1. Mindfulness meditation (eight weeks, one session/week, daily individual practice) vs control: statistically significant difference in favour of control for quality of life - physical aspects. 2. Mindfulness meditation (single 5-minute session) vs control: benefit in favour of mindfulness for stress outcome in both time-points. None of the included studies analysed safety and harms outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Although two studies have showed statistically significant difference, only one showed effectiveness of mindfulness meditation in improving perceived stress. This study focused on one single session of mindfulness of 5 minutes for adult cancer patients in palliative care, but it was considered as possessing high risk of bias. Other schemes of mindfulness meditation did not show benefit in any outcome evaluated (low and very low quality evidence).	1a
15476513	Permanent 125I-seed brachytherapy or radical prostatectomy: a prospective comparison considering oncological and quality of life results.	OBJECTIVE: To assess the quality of life in patients with prostate cancer after permanent brachytherapy (BT) or radical perineal prostatectomy (RP). PATIENTS AND METHODS: The American Brachytherapy Society recommends the permanent implantation of radioactive seeds as a monotherapy for patients with T1-T2aN0M0 prostate cancer and a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level of < or = 10 ng/mL, a Gleason score of <7 and a prostate volume of <60 mL. Using these criteria, 132 patients with low-risk prostate cancer were selected; 52 had BT with 125I-seed implantation, 38 had RP with unilateral nerve-sparing (RP + NS) and 42 extended RP (RP group). Only patients with unilateral tumour on biopsy were considered. Before therapy and 6, 12 and 24 months afterward, patients completed questionnaires to assess perceived health and function. PSA relapse was diagnosed with a PSA of >0.1 ng/mL for patients in the RP groups, and three consecutive PSA increases for those after BT. RESULTS: Extraprostatic tumours were found in 18% of specimens taken during RP, and bilateral tumours in 63% of patients. After a mean follow-up of 27 months, there was PSA relapse in two of the 80 patients in the RP and RP + NS groups, and six of the 52 patients in the BT group; a significant difference, with a hazard ratio of 5.2. The acute morbidity was low in all groups. At 1 year, more than two incontinence pads were used by 5% of patients after RP and by 4% after BT. Similarly, at 1 year 15% of patients after RP and 13% after BT were bothered by urinary incontinence. Newly-developed fecal soiling was reported by 4%, 5% and 11% of the RP, RP + NS and BT groups respectively; none of the patients after RP and 4% after BT were bothered by this symptom. The duration and stiffness of erection was assessed after 1 year and reported to be equal or slightly decreased by a third after RP + NS and 38% after BT. Taking a 5-10 point difference as clinically relevant, role, emotional and social functioning were improved considerably after RP + NS than after BT, but sexual activity was impaired significantly after RP + NS than after BT. CONCLUSIONS: Both therapies showed typical acute and late morbidity; the most bothersome late symptoms were urinary incontinence for patients after RP and fecal soiling after BT. Sexual function was impaired significantly in patients who were potent before RP + NS, whereas after BT men reported only a minor change in sexual performance at 1 year. Tumour control after a median follow-up of 27 months was better after RP but biochemical recurrence may still occur after > or = 5 years; therefore the present results are not mature enough and there were too few patients to provide a more definitive statement. As approximately 18% of patients considered to be appropriate candidates for BT had tumours extending beyond the prostate capsule or invading the seminal vesicles, nomograms are needed for more accurate information before therapy.	2a
19368137	Intra-arterial hepatic chemoembolization (TACE) of liver metastases from ocular melanoma with slow-release irinotecan-eluting beads. Early results of a phase II clinical study.	BACKGROUND: Uveal melanoma (UM) is the most common primary intraocular malignancy in adults and the liver is the predominant site of metastases (LM). If metastases appear, none of the systemic treatments established for cutaneous melanoma so far have any significant impact. Several authors have adopted transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) as palliation. TACE combines hepatic artery embolization with infusion of concentrated doses of chemotherapeutic drugs. DC Beads are new embolic products that can be loaded with irinotecan (IRI). The beads consist of polyvinyl alcohol microspheres modified with sulfonic acid groups and are available at different size ranges from 100 to 900 microns in diameter. The use of IRI as drug-eluting beads seems to optimize TACE in UM. OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to assess the safety and efficacy of this new kind of TACE in a phase II clinical study. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Ten patients with LM from UM were treated with TACE-containing beads preloaded with IRI (100 mg). RESULTS: All patients had an objective response, three presented a very good partial response and seven obtained a partial response. The median follow-up time from the beginning of therapy was 6.5 months (range 4-9 months). Eight patients are alive at the time of this analysis. The most important adverse event was abdominal pain during the procedure. Adequate supportive treatment with antibiotic and antiemetic prophylaxis, desametazone and intravenous hydration is strictly necessary until stabilization of serum levels of transaminases and to prevent infections. A major analgesic such as morphine must be used before and after the procedure. CONCLUSION: TACE containing beads preloaded with IRI is effective in the treatment of LM from UM. This approach seems to have better efficacy than previous TACE regimens adopted.	4
18640062	Impact of preoperative endorectal MRI stage classification on neurovascular bundle sparing aggressiveness and the radical prostatectomy positive margin rate.	INTRODUCTION: Inability to accurately determine extracapsular extension (ECE) and neurovascular bundle (NVB) tumor involvement prior to or during radical prostatectomy (RP) remains problematic. Laparoscopic prostatectomy has the additional challenge of lack of tactile tumor assessment. Our goal is to determine the impact of preoperative endorectal magnetic resonance imaging (eMRI) staging upon NVB sparing aggressiveness and the RP surgical margin rate. METHODS: Sixty-two patients who underwent RP (46 laparoscopic and 16 open retropubic) from March 2002 to February 2005 and had preoperative eMRI staging were evaluated to determine the impact of apparent ECE upon NVB sparing aggressiveness and subsequent RP margin positivity. RESULTS: Thirty-four (83%) of 41 pathologic stage T2 tumors and 8 (38%) of 21 pathologic stage T3 tumors were accurately classified by eMRI. Eighty-three percent of eMRI stage T2 classified tumors underwent bilateral NVB sparing, whereas only 55% of laparoscopic (P = 0.09) and 75% of open RP (P = 1.0) tumors classified as eMRI stage T3 underwent bilateral NVB sparing. The overall surgical margin positive rate was 30% for laparoscopic and 25% for open RPs. Pathologic T3 tumors erroneously classified as T2 demonstrated a trend towards greater positive margin rate (54% vs. 13% [P = 0.07], 63% vs. 14% laparoscopic RP [P = 0.12]). Eighty percent of clinical T1c, Gleason score 6, pathologic T3 tumors classified erroneously as T2 by eMRI had positive margins. CONCLUSIONS: The usefulness of endorectal MRI in detecting ECE is limited. Patients with eMRIs suggesting no ECE demonstrated a trend towards more aggressive NVB sparing and an increased positive surgical margin rate at laparoscopic prostatectomy.	3a
23439657	Black cohosh and breast cancer: a systematic review.	BACKGROUND: Many women use black cohosh as a natural treatment for menopausal symptoms. However, controversy exists around safety in breast cancer, because of its purported estrogenic activity. We conducted a systematic review of black cohosh use in women with or at risk of breast cancer. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and AMED from inception to July 2012 and October 2012 for human interventional or observational data pertaining to the safety and efficacy of black cohosh in patients with or at risk of breast cancer, including an assessment of the effect of black cohosh on estrogen responsive tissues. RESULTS: Of 450 records, we included 26 articles: 14 randomized controlled trials, 7 uncontrolled trials, and 5 observational studies.The evidence on efficacy for ho t flashes is divided, with some benefits seen when compared with baseline, but not when compared with placebo. Two observational studies found no association between black cohosh and risk of breast cancer, whereas 2 studies reported significant reductions in risk of primary breast cancer among postmenopausal women (adjusted odds ratio = 0.47, 95% confidence interval = 0.27-0.82), and risk of recurrence (adjusted hazard ratio = 0.75, 95% confidence interval = 0.63-0.89). Seventeen trials showed no significant impact on circulating hormone levels or proliferation in estrogen responsive tissues. CONCLUSIONS: Current evidence does not support an association between black cohosh and increased risk of breast cancer. There is a lack of evidence supporting the efficacy of black cohosh for reduction of hot flashes in breast cancer patients. Given conflicting but promising results, and apparent safety, further research is warranted.	1a
16615102	Sensitivity and specificity of confocal laser-scanning microscopy for in vivo diagnosis of malignant skin tumors.	BACKGROUND: Melanoma and nonmelanoma skin cancer are the most frequent malignant tumors by far among whites. Currently, early diagnosis is the most efficient method for preventing a fatal outcome. In vivo confocal laser-scanning microscopy (CLSM) is a recently developed potential diagnostic tool. METHODS: One hundred seventeen melanocytic skin lesions and 45 nonmelanocytic skin lesions (90 benign nevi, 27 malignant melanomas, 15 basal cell carcinomas, and 30 seborrheic keratoses) were sampled consecutively and were examined using proprietary CLSM equipment. Stored images were rated by 4 independent observers. RESULTS: Differentiation between melanoma and all other lesions based solely on CLSM examination was achieved with a positive predictive value of 94.22%. Malignant lesions (melanoma and basal cell carcinoma) as a group were diagnosed with a positive predictive value of 96.34%. Assessment of distinct CLSM features showed a strong interobserver correlation (kappa >0.80 for 11 of 13 criteria). Classification and regression tree analysis yielded a 3-step algorithm based on only 3 criteria, facilitating a correct classification in 96.30% of melanomas, 98.89% of benign nevi, and 100% of basal cell carcinomas and seborrheic keratoses. CONCLUSIONS: In vivo CLSM examination appeared to be a promising method for the noninvasive assessment of melanoma and nonmelanoma skin tumors.	2b
29757459	Individual meaning-centered psychotherapy for the treatment of psychological and existential distress: A randomized controlled trial in patients with advanced cancer.	BACKGROUND: Patients with advanced cancer have high rates of psychological distress, including depression, anxiety, and spiritual despair. This study examined the effectiveness of individual meaning-centered psychotherapy (IMCP) in comparison with supportive psychotherapy (SP) and enhanced usual care (EUC) in improving spiritual well-being and quality of life and reducing psychological distress in patients with advanced cancer. METHODS: Patients (n = 321) were randomly assigned to IMCP (n = 109), SP (n = 108), or EUC (n = 104). Assessments were conducted at 4 time points: before intervention, midtreatment (4 weeks), 8 weeks after treatment, and 16 weeks after treatment. RESULTS: Significant treatment effects (small to medium in magnitude) were observed for IMCP, in comparison with EUC, for 5 of 7 outcome variables (quality of life, sense of meaning, spiritual well-being, anxiety, and desire for hastened death), with Cohen's d ranging from 0.1 to 0.34; no significant improvement was observed for patients receiving SP (d < 0.15 and P > .05 for all variables). The effect of IMCP was significantly greater than the effect of SP for quality of life and sense of meaning (d = 0.19) but not for the remaining study variables. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides further support for the efficacy of IMCP as a treatment for psychological and existential/spiritual distress in patients with advanced cancer. Significant treatment effects (small to moderate effect sizes) were observed in comparison with usual care, and somewhat more modest differences in improvement (small effect sizes) were observed in comparison with SP. Thus, the benefits of meaning-centered psychotherapy appear to be unique to the intervention and highlight the importance of addressing existential issues with patients approaching the end of life.

10203878	How effective are supplementary doses of opioids for dyspnea in terminally ill cancer patients? A randomized continuous sequential clinical trial.	Supplementary doses of opioids are recommended to relieve dyspnea in terminally ill cancer patients. We conducted a randomized continuous sequential clinical trial to evaluate their efficacy. We recruited 33 terminally ill cancer patients from three palliative care centers, all of whom had persistent dyspnea after rest and treatment with oxygen. Patients formed 15 successive pairs matched on route of administration. Within each pair, the order of allocation was randomly assigned, one patient receiving 25%, the other 50% of his 4-hourly opioid dose. Five measurements of dyspnea intensity and respiratory frequency were made during 4 hours of follow-up. For each pair, a preference was attributed to the more effective regimen. The two regimens received an almost equal number of paired preferences (8 vs. 7). Overall, both mean dyspnea intensity and respiratory frequency decreased significantly relative to baseline. Dyspnea reduction was relatively greater in patients with initially low and moderate dyspnea intensity. In terminally ill cancer patients with persistent dyspnea, 25% of the equivalent 4-hourly dose of opioid may be sufficient to reduce both dyspnea intensity and tachypnea for 4 hours.	1b
29723235	Effects of Anma therapy (Japanese massage) on health-related quality of life in gynecologic cancer survivors: A randomized controlled trial.	OBJECTIVES: Anma therapy (Japanese massage therapy, AMT) significantly reduces the severity of physical complaints in survivors of gynecologic cancer. However, whether this reduction of severity is accompanied by improvement in health-related quality of life is unknown. METHODS: Forty survivors of gynecologic cancer were randomly allocated to either an AMT group that received one 40-min AMT session per week for 8 weeks or a no-AMT group. We prospectively measured quality of life by using the Japanese version of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer QLQ-C30 version 3.0 (EORTC QLQ-C30) at baseline and at 8-week follow-up. The QLQ-C30 response rate was 100%. Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS), Profile of Mood States (POMS), and Measure of Adjustment to Cancer were also prespecified and prospectively evaluated. RESULTS: The QLQ-C30 Global Health Status and Quality of Life showed significant improvement at 8 weeks (P = 0.042) in the AMT group compared with the no-AMT group, and the estimated mean difference reached a minimal clinically important difference of 10 points (10.4 points, 95% CI = 1.2 to 19.6). Scores on fatigue and insomnia showed significant improvement in the AMT group compared with the no-AMT group (P = 0.047 and 0.003, respectively). There were no significant between-group improvements in HADS anxiety and depression scales; however, POMS-assessed anger-hostility showed significant improvement in the AMT group compared with the no-AMT group (p = 0.028). CONCLUSIONS: AMT improved health-related quality of life in gynecologic cancer survivors. AMT can be of potential benefit for applications in oncology.	1b
29909967	Tips and tricks to improve sentinel lymph node mapping with Indocyanin green in endometrial cancer.	"OBJECTIVE: To determine the validity of sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy with ICG in endometrial cancer and to evaluate the factors associated with poor mapping or false negative. METHODS: We reviewed all patients who underwent primary surgery for endometrial carcinoma with SLN mapping using ICG followed by pelvic lymphadenectomy from February 2014 to December 2015. SLNs were ultrastaged on final pathology. Patients' demographics, surgical approach and histopathological factors were prospectively collected. Detection rate, sensitivity and negative predictive value (NPV) were calculated and univariate analysis was performed to evaluate factors associated with failed bilateral detection of SLNs. RESULTS: A total of 119 patients were included. The overall and bilateral detection rates were 93% and 74%. Sensitivity and NPV were 100% in patients with bilateral detection; 95% and 99% respectively in cases with at least unilateral detection. Advanced FIGO stage (III or IV) was the only factor related to failed bilateral detection (p=0.01). In 14 hemi-pelvis, the specimen labelled as SLN did not contain nodal tissue on final pathology (only lymphatic channels), which represented 37% of the ""failed detection"" cases. One false negative occurred in a patient with an ipsilateral clinically suspicious enlarged lymph node. CONCLUSION: ICG is an excellent tracer for SLN mapping in endometrial cancer. Advanced FIGO stage correlated with failed bilateral detection (p=0.01). Suspicious lymph nodes should be removed regardless of the mapping. Care should be taken to ensure that SLN specimen actually contains nodal tissue and not only swollen lymphatic channels, as this represents a significant cause of failed SLN mapping."	4
12226148	A randomized trial comparing radical prostatectomy with watchful waiting in early prostate cancer.	BACKGROUND: Radical prostatectomy is widely used in the treatment of early prostate cancer. The possible survival benefit of this treatment, however, is unclear. We conducted a randomized trial to address this question. METHODS: From October 1989 through February 1999, 695 men with newly diagnosed prostate cancer in International Union against Cancer clinical stage T1b, T1c, or T2 were randomly assigned to watchful waiting or radical prostatectomy. We achieved complete follow-up through the year 2000 with blinded evaluation of causes of death. The primary end point was death due to prostate cancer, and the secondary end points were overall mortality, metastasis-free survival, and local progression. RESULTS: During a median of 6.2 years of follow-up, 62 men in the watchful-waiting group and 53 in the radical-prostatectomy group died (P=0.31). Death due to prostate cancer occurred in 31 of 348 of those assigned to watchful waiting (8.9 percent) and in 16 of 347 of those assigned to radical prostatectomy (4.6 percent) (relative hazard, 0.50; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.27 to 0.91; P=0.02). Death due to other causes occurred in 31 of 348 men in the watchful-waiting group (8.9 percent) and in 37 of 347 men in the radical-prostatectomy group (10.6 percent). The men assigned to surgery had a lower relative risk of distant metastases than the men assigned to watchful waiting (relative hazard, 0.63; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.41 to 0.96). CONCLUSIONS: In this randomized trial, radical prostatectomy significantly reduced disease-specific mortality, but there was no significant difference between surgery and watchful waiting in terms of overall survival.	1a
22252775	Augmenting advance care planning in poor prognosis cancer with a video decision aid: a preintervention-postintervention study.	"BACKGROUND: The authors tested whether an educational video on the goals of care in advanced cancer (life-prolonging care, basic care, or comfort care) helped patients understand these goals and had an impact on their preferences for resuscitation. METHODS: A survey of 80 patients with advanced cancer was conducted before and after they viewed an educational video. The outcomes of interest included changes in goals of care preference and knowledge and consistency of preferences with code status. RESULTS: Before viewing the video, 10 patients (13%) preferred life-prolonging care, 24 patients (30%) preferred basic care, 29 patients (36%) preferred comfort care, and 17 patients (21%) were unsure. Preferences did not change after the video, when 9 patients (11%) chose life-prolonging care, 28 patients (35%) chose basic care, 29 patients (36%) chose comfort care, and, 14 patients (18%) were unsure (P = .28). Compared with baseline, after the video presentation, more patients did not want cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) (71% vs 62%; P = .03) or ventilation (80% vs 67%; P = .008). Knowledge about goals of care and likelihood of resuscitation increased after the video (P < .001). Of the patients who did not want CPR or ventilation after the video augmentation, only 4 patients (5%) had a documented do-not-resuscitate order in their medical record (kappa statistic, -0.01; 95% confidence interval, -0.06 to 0.04). Acceptability of the video was high. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with advanced cancer did not change care preferences after viewing the video, but fewer wanted CPR or ventilation. Documented code status was inconsistent with patient preferences. Patients were more knowledgeable after the video, reported that the video was acceptable, and said they would recommend it to others. The current results indicated that this type of video may enable patients to visualize ""goals of care,"" enriching patient understanding of worsening health states and better informing decision making."	3a
21600759	Extended schedule, escalated dose temozolomide versus dacarbazine in stage IV melanoma: final results of a randomised phase III study (EORTC 18032).	PURPOSE: To compare the efficacy of an extended schedule escalated dose of temozolomide versus standard dose dacarbazine in a large population of patients with stage IV melanoma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 859 patients were randomised to receive oral temozolomide at 150 mg/m(2)/day for seven consecutive days every 2 weeks or dacarbazine, administered as an intravenous infusion at 1000 mg/m(2)/day on day 1 every 3 weeks. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS), using an intent-to-treat principle. EudraCT number 2004-000654-23 NCI registration number NCT00005052. RESULTS: Median OS was 9.1 months in the temozolomide arm and 9.4 months in the dacarbazine arm, with a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.00 (95%confidence interval [CI]: 0.86, 1.17; P=0.99). Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 2.3 months in the temozolomide arm and 2.2 months in the dacarbazine arm, with a HR of 0.92 (95%CI: 0.80, 1.06; P=0.27). In patients with measurable disease, overall response rate was higher in the temozolomide arm than in the dacarbazine arm (14.5% versus 9.8%, respectively), but the median duration of response was longer for dacarbazine. The extended schedule, escalated dose temozolomide arm showed more toxicity than the standard dose, single agent dacarbazine arm. The most common non-haematological treatment emergent adverse events reported in both treatment arms were nausea, fatigue and vomiting and constipation. CONCLUSION: Extended schedule escalated dose Temozolomide (7 days on 7 days off) is feasible and has an acceptable safety profile, but does not improve OS and PFS in metastatic melanoma when compared to standard dose dacarbazine.	1b
376098	Prospective comparison of intralesional and multipuncture BCG in recurrent intradermal melanoma.	Fifty-nine patients with metastatic melanoma predominantly localized in the skin were randomly assigned to treatment with BCG given either intralesionally (IL-BCG) or by multiple puncture vaccination at a nontumor bearing site in the skin (MPV-BCG). Half the patients with IL-BCG experienced moderate fever, chills and malaise, suggesting systemic exposure to this live organism. However, only three of these patients required systemic antituberculous chemotherapy and all responded to it. MPV-BCG treated patients experienced significantly less systemic toxicity. Among fully evaluable patients 45% objective response rate was seen in the IL-BCG group and a 9% response rate in the MPV-BCG group, a significant difference. The only complete responses were seen in the IL-BCG group. Among fully evaluable patients, median survival was 21.1 months in the IL-BCG group and 13.3 months in the MPV-BCG groups (NSD). No patients with pretreatment anergy to all skin tests utilized, experienced objective response to BCG.	4
29161214	A Randomized Trial of an Advanced Sun Safety Intervention for Vacationers at 41 North American Resorts.	Taking vacations in sunny locations is associated with the development of skin cancer. This study tested a multi-component sun protection intervention based on diffusion of innovations theory and transportation theory designed to increase vacationers' comprehensive sun protection, i.e., use of clothing, hats, and shade, and use, pre-application, and reapplication of sunscreen. The trial enrolled 41 warm weather resorts in North America in a pair-matched group randomized pretest-posttest design and assessed samples of adult vacationers at resort outdoor recreation venues regarding sun protection at pretest (n = 3,531) and posttest (n = 3,226). While results showed no overall effect of the intervention on comprehensive sun protection across venues, the intervention produced statistically significant improvements in sun protection at waterside venues (pools and beaches). The intervention's overall effects may have been impeded by a lack of uniformly robust implementation, low interest in skin cancer prevention by guests, or shortcomings of the theories used to create prevention messages. The intervention may have worked best with guests in the highest-risk recreation venue, i.e., waterside recreation where they exposed the most skin. Alternative approaches that alter resort organizations, such as through changes in policy, environmental features, or occupational efforts might be more effective than targeting vacationers with behavior-change messages.	1a
16121344	Surgical treatment of extravasation injuries.	The authors present their experience of treating anti-cancer drug extravasation by means of a composite surgical technique that consists of infiltration with physiological solution and hyaluronidase and subsequent manual aspiration of solutes alternated with profuse irrigation of the infiltrated area. In the immediate post-op we carry out a medical therapy that consists of calciparine and topic antibiotic and/or steroid creams. Since the year 2000 this technique has been used on 25 patients. We have had neither complications nor scars.	4
19805675	Racial differences in predictors of intensive end-of-life care in patients with advanced cancer.	PURPOSE: Black patients are more likely than white patients to receive life-prolonging care near death. This study examined predictors of intensive end-of-life (EOL) care for black and white advanced cancer patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Three hundred two self-reported black (n = 68) and white (n = 234) patients with stage IV cancer and caregivers participated in a US multisite, prospective, interview-based cohort study from September 2002 to August 2008. Participants were observed until death, a median of 116 days from baseline. Patient-reported baseline predictors included EOL care preference, physician trust, EOL discussion, completion of a Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) order, and religious coping. Caregiver postmortem interviews provided information regarding EOL care received. Intensive EOL care was defined as resuscitation and/or ventilation followed by death in an intensive care unit. RESULTS: Although black patients were three times more likely than white patients to receive intensive EOL care (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 3.04, P = .037), white patients with a preference for this care were approximately three times more likely to receive it (aOR = 13.20, P = .008) than black patients with the same preference (aOR = 4.46, P = .058). White patients who reported an EOL discussion or DNR order did not receive intensive EOL care; similar reports were not protective for black patients (aOR = 0.53, P = .460; and aOR = 0.65, P = .618, respectively). CONCLUSION: White patients with advanced cancer are more likely than black patients with advanced cancer to receive the EOL care they initially prefer. EOL discussions and DNR orders are not associated with care for black patients, highlighting a need to improve communication between black patients and their clinicians.	2b
17296375	Sentinel lymph node dissection for prostate cancer: experience with more than 1,000 patients.	PURPOSE: We determined the incidence of positive pelvic lymph nodes in men undergoing radical retropubic prostatectomy and describe the correlation with prostate specific antigen, histological grade and stage. We examined whether tumor cells are localized in the sentinel nodes only or also in other nonsentinel lymph nodes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 1,055 men with prostate cancer underwent radio guided pelvic lymph node dissection and radical retropubic prostatectomy. In men with prostate specific antigen 20 ng/ml or less and biopsy Gleason score 7 or less only sentinel nodes were removed. In men with prostate specific antigen more than 20 ng/ml or Gleason score greater than 7 extended pelvic lymph node dissection was also performed. RESULTS: Positive lymph nodes were found in 207 men (19.6%). In 63.3% of the men these lymph nodes were detected outside of the region of standard lymphadenectomy. The percent of patients with positive nodes was greater than predicted by currently used nomograms. The higher the preoperative prostate specific antigen, pathological stage and grade, the greater the percent of men with positive sentinel and nonsentinel lymph nodes (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: When deciding on pelvic lymph node dissection, sentinel or extended lymphadenectomy should be performed since more than half of patients have positive nodes outside of the region of standard lymphadenectomy. In cases of positive sentinel nodes extended lymph node dissection should be performed since tumor cells are also detectable in nonsentinel lymph nodes.	2a
27340121	Adherence to Diet and Physical Activity Cancer Prevention Guidelines and Cancer Outcomes: A Systematic Review.	Many studies have reported that adherence to health promotion guidelines for diet, physical activity, and maintenance of healthy body weight may decrease cancer incidence and mortality. A systematic review was performed to examine associations between adherence to established cancer prevention guidelines for diet and physical activity and overall cancer incidence and mortality. PubMed, Google Scholar, and Cochrane Reviews databases were searched following the current recommendations of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis Approach (PRISMA). Twelve studies met inclusion criteria for this review. High versus low adherence to established nutrition and physical activity cancer prevention guidelines was consistently and significantly associated with decreases of 10% to 61% in overall cancer incidence and mortality. Consistent significant reductions were also shown for breast cancer incidence (19%-60%), endometrial cancer incidence (23%-60%), and colorectal cancer incidence in both men and women (27%-52%). Findings for lung cancer incidence were equivocal, and no significant relationships were found between adherence and ovarian or prostate cancers. Adhering to cancer prevention guidelines for diet and physical activity is consistently associated with lower risks of overall cancer incidence and mortality, including for some site-specific cancers.

23860530	A randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind study of aprepitant in nondrinking women younger than 70 years receiving moderately emetogenic chemotherapy.	BACKGROUND: We evaluated the efficacy of aprepitant plus granisetron and an increased dose of dexamethasone in selected patients undergoing moderately emetogenic chemotherapy (MEC). METHODS: Nondrinking women <70 years undergoing MEC were randomly assigned to aprepitant (day 1, 125 mg; days 2 and 3, 80 mg) or placebo. Dexamethasone on days 1-3 was 12, 4, and 4 mg with aprepitant and 20, 8, and 8 mg with placebo. The primary end point was complete response (CR; no emesis or rescue therapy) during 120 h of the first cycle. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify predictors of overall CR. RESULTS: Of the 94 patients enrolled, 91 were assessable. Most received carboplatin-based chemotherapy. In the aprepitant (n=45) and placebo (n=46) groups, the overall, acute (day 1), and delayed (days 2-5) CR rates were 62% and 52%, 98% and 96%, and 62% and 52%, respectively. Although not statistically significant, the overall CR rate was 10% higher in the aprepitant group. Both regimens were well tolerated. On multivariate analysis, advanced ovarian cancer (OR, 0.26 (0.10-0.72)) was independently associated with a lower CR. CONCLUSION: Even with an increased dose of dexamethasone, aprepitant seemed more effective than placebo in these selected patients undergoing MEC; however, delayed phase management remains a significant problem.	1b
20888992	Prednisone plus cabazitaxel or mitoxantrone for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer progressing after docetaxel treatment: a randomised open-label trial.	BACKGROUND: Cabazitaxel is a novel tubulin-binding taxane drug with antitumour activity in docetaxel-resistant cancers. We aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of cabazitaxel plus prednisone with those of mitoxantrone plus prednisone in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer with progressive disease after docetaxel-based treatment. METHODS: We undertook an open-label randomised phase 3 trial in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who had received previous hormone therapy, but whose disease had progressed during or after treatment with a docetaxel-containing regimen. Participants were treated with 10 mg oral prednisone daily, and were randomly assigned to receive either 12 mg/m(2) mitoxantrone intravenously over 15-30 min or 25 mg/m(2) cabazitaxel intravenously over 1 h every 3 weeks. The random allocation schedule was computer-generated; patients and treating physicians were not masked to treatment allocation, but the study team was masked to the data analysis. The primary endpoint was overall survival. Secondary endpoints included progression-free survival and safety. Analysis was by intention to treat. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00417079. FINDINGS: 755 men were allocated to treatment groups (377 mitoxantrone, 378 cabazitaxel) and were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. At the cutoff for the final analysis (Sept 25, 2009), median survival was 15.1 months (95% CI 14.1-16.3) in the cabazitaxel group and 12.7 months (11.6-13.7) in the mitoxantrone group. The hazard ratio for death of men treated with cabazitaxel compared with those taking mitoxantrone was 0.70 (95% CI 0.59-0.83, p<0.0001). Median progression-free survival was 2.8 months (95% CI 2.4-3.0) in the cabazitaxel group and 1.4 months (1.4-1.7) in the mitoxantrone group (HR 0.74, 0.64-0.86, p<0.0001). The most common clinically significant grade 3 or higher adverse events were neutropenia (cabazitaxel, 303 [82%] patients vs mitoxantrone, 215 [58%]) and diarrhoea (23 [6%] vs one [<1%]). 28 (8%) patients in the cabazitaxel group and five (1%) in the mitoxantrone group had febrile neutropenia. INTERPRETATION: Treatment with cabazitaxel plus prednisone has important clinical antitumour activity, improving overall survival in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer whose disease has progressed during or after docetaxel-based therapy.

15247739	15-year experience with the management of extrinsic ureteral obstruction with indwelling ureteral stents.	PURPOSE: We assessed the success of retrograde placement of indwelling ureteral stents in the management of ureteral obstruction due to extrinsic compression. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between July 1987 and December 2002 adequate followup was available for 101 patients who underwent primary retrograde ureteral stenting for extrinsic ureteral obstruction. Mean age at presentation was 61.4 years (range 33 to 90). Chart review was performed on all patients for primary diagnosis, symptomatology, degree of hydronephrosis, creatinine levels (baseline, treatment and posttreatment), location of compression, size and number of stents used, progression to percutaneous nephrostomy tube (PNT), stent failure, days to stent failure, post-stent therapy and status at last followup. RESULTS: Mean length of followup was 11 months (range 1 to 127). In 101 patients 138 ureteral units (UU) were stented. Total stent failure occurred in 41 (40.6%) patients and 58 (42.0%) UU. A total of 40 (29.0%) UU required PNTs at a mean of 40.3 days (range 0 to 330) with 18 PNTs placed in less than 1 week. Cases of stent failure that did not undergo PNT placement included 18 (13.0%) UU at a mean of 52.4 days (range 3 to 128). A total of 90 (89.1%) patients had metastatic cancer at stenting with 32.2% dead at 5.8 months (range 1 to 32). Univariate and multivariate analyses identified cancer diagnosis, baseline creatinine greater than 1.3 mg/dl and post-stent systemic treatment as predictors of stent failure. Proximal location of compression and treatment creatinine greater than 3.11 mg/dl were marginal predictors of failure on univariate analysis, while proximal location of obstruction was also marginally significant on multivariate analysis. No predictors were identified for early stent failure (less than 1 week). CONCLUSIONS: At almost 1 year followup stent failure due to extrinsic compression occurred in nearly half of treated patients. Analysis of data revealed a diagnosis of cancer, baseline mild renal insufficiency and metastatic disease requiring chemotherapy or radiation as predictors of stent failure. Managing extrinsic compression by retrograde stenting continues to be a practical but guarded decision and should be tailored to each patient.	2a
28975307	Effect of Lorazepam With Haloperidol vs Haloperidol Alone on Agitated Delirium in Patients With Advanced Cancer Receiving Palliative Care: A Randomized Clinical Trial.	Importance: The use of benzodiazepines to control agitation in delirium in the last days of life is controversial. Objective: To compare the effect of lorazepam vs placebo as an adjuvant to haloperidol for persistent agitation in patients with delirium in the setting of advanced cancer. Design, Setting, and Participants: Single-center, double-blind, parallel-group, randomized clinical trial conducted at an acute palliative care unit at MD Anderson Cancer Center, Texas, enrolling 93 patients with advanced cancer and agitated delirium despite scheduled haloperidol from February 11, 2014, to June 30, 2016, with data collection completed in October 2016. Interventions: Lorazepam (3 mg) intravenously (n = 47) or placebo (n = 43) in addition to haloperidol (2 mg) intravenously upon the onset of an agitation episode. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was change in Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS) score (range, -5 [unarousable] to 4 [very agitated or combative]) from baseline to 8 hours after treatment administration. Secondary end points were rescue neuroleptic use, delirium recall, comfort (perceived by caregivers and nurses), communication capacity, delirium severity, adverse effects, discharge outcomes, and overall survival. Results: Among 90 randomized patients (mean age, 62 years; women, 42 [47%]), 58 (64%) received the study medication and 52 (90%) completed the trial. Lorazepam + haloperidol resulted in a significantly greater reduction of RASS score at 8 hours (-4.1 points) than placebo + haloperidol (-2.3 points) (mean difference, -1.9 points [95% CI, -2.8 to -0.9]; P < .001). The lorazepam + haloperidol group required less median rescue neuroleptics (2.0 mg) than the placebo + haloperidol group (4.0 mg) (median difference, -1.0 mg [95% CI, -2.0 to 0]; P = .009) and was perceived to be more comfortable by both blinded caregivers and nurses (caregivers: 84% for the lorazepam + haloperidol group vs 37% for the placebo + haloperidol group; mean difference, 47% [95% CI, 14% to 73%], P = .007; nurses: 77% for the lorazepam + haloperidol group vs 30% for the placebo + haloperidol group; mean difference, 47% [95% CI, 17% to 71%], P = .005). No significant between-group differences were found in delirium-related distress and survival. The most common adverse effect was hypokinesia (3 patients in the lorazepam + haloperidol group [19%] and 4 patients in the placebo + haloperidol group [27%]). Conclusions and Relevance: In this preliminary trial of hospitalized patients with agitated delirium in the setting of advanced cancer, the addition of lorazepam to haloperidol compared with haloperidol alone resulted in a significantly greater reduction in agitation at 8 hours. Further research is needed to assess generalizability and adverse effects. Trial Registration: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT01949662.	1a
19786669	Targeted high-resolution ultrasound is not an effective substitute for sentinel lymph node biopsy in patients with primary cutaneous melanoma.	PURPOSE: To reassess traditional ultrasound descriptors of sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastases, to determine the minimum cross-sectional area (CSA) of an SLN metastasis detectable by ultrasound (US), and to establish whether targeted, high-resolution US of SLNs identified by lymphoscintigraphy before initial melanoma surgery can be used as a substitute for excisional SLN biopsy. METHODS: US was performed on SLNs identified in 871 lymph node fields in 716 patients. SLN biopsy was performed within 24 hours of lymphoscintigraphy and US examination. The CSA of each SLN metastatic deposit was determined sonographically and histologically. RESULTS: The sensitivity of targeted US in the detection of positive SLNs was 24.3% (95% CI, 19.5% to 28.7%), and the specificity was 96.8% (95% CI, 95.9% to 97.7%). The sensitivity was highest for neck SLNs (45.8%) and improved with greater Breslow thickness. The median histologic CSA of the SLN metastatic deposits was 0.39 mm(2) (12.75 mm(2) for US true-positive results and 0.22 mm(2) for US false-negative results). True-positive, US-detected SLNs had significantly greater CSAs (t test P < .001) than undetected SLN metastases and were more likely to be spherical in cross-section. More than two sonographic descriptors of SLN metastases or rounding of the node alone were factors highly suggestive of a melanoma deposit. CONCLUSION: US is not an appropriate substitute for SLN biopsy, but it is of value in preoperative SLN assessment and postoperative monitoring.	2b
26806566	Music Therapy in Palliative Care.	BACKGROUND: Music therapy has been used successfully for over 30 years as part of palliative care programs for severely ill patients. There is nonetheless a lack of high-quality studies that would enable an evidence-based evaluation of its psychological and physiological effects. METHODS: In a randomized controlled trial, 84 hospitalized patients in palliative care were assigned to one of two treatment arms--music therapy and control. The music therapy intervention consisted of two sessions of live music-based relaxation exercises; the patients in the control group listened to a verbal relaxation exercise. The primary endpoints were self-ratings of relaxation, well-being, and acute pain, assessed using visual analog scales. Heart rate variability and health-related quality of life were considered as secondary outcomes. The primary data analysis was performed according to the intention-to-treat principle. RESULTS: Analyses of covariance revealed that music therapy was more effective than the control treatment at promoting relaxation (F = 13.7; p <0.001) and well-being (F = 6.41; p = 0.01). This effect was supported by a significantly greater increase in high-frequency oscillations of the heart rate (F = 8.13; p = 0.01). Music therapy did not differ from control treatment with respect to pain reduction (F = 0.4; p = 0.53), but it led to a significantly greater reduction in the fatigue score on the quality-of-life scale (F = 4.74; p = 0.03). CONCLUSION: Music therapy is an effective treatment with a low dropout rate for the promotion of relaxation and well-being in terminally ill persons undergoing palliative care.	1b
24163082	Efficacy and safety between temozolomide alone and temozolomide-based double therapy for malignant melanoma: a meta-analysis.	"Temozolomide (TMZ) has received much attention, notably in the treatment of malignant glioma and malignant melanoma. The objective of this study was to compare the clinical efficacy and safety of TMZ alone and TMZ-based combination drug therapy in patients with melanoma. Using ""temozolomide"" as a keyword combined with ""melanoma"" and ""randomized controlled trials"" as Medical Subject Headings, the following electronic databases were searched: the Cochrane library, MEDLINE, EBSCO, EMBASE, Ovid, cNKI, and cBMDisc. The evaluating indicators were overall response rate (ORR), 1-year survival rate, and several of the most frequent adverse events. Five randomized controlled trials met our criteria and were included in the meta-analysis, with a total of 703 participants (309 patients received TMZ alone, and 394 patients received combined regimens). The meta-analysis showed that the ORR for TMZ-based drug therapy was higher than TMZ alone [relative risk (RR) = 1.44; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.06-1.95], but the 1-year survival rate was not significantly different between the two groups (RR = 1.13; 95% CI, 0.92-1.40). These results suggested that the impact of these increased response rates was not translated into a survival benefit. Moreover, we found no difference in the incidence of adverse events analyzed. The currently available evidence showed that the TMZ-combination therapy may moderately improve the response rate, but there was no corresponding increased toxicity. Future large-scale, high-quality, placebo-controlled, double-blind trials are needed."	1a
22702482	Radiosurgery for melanoma brain metastases in the ipilimumab era and the possibility of longer survival.	OBJECT: A prospectively collected cohort of 77 patients who underwent definitive radiosurgery between 2002 and 2010 for melanoma brain metastases was retrospectively reviewed to assess the impact of ipilimumab use and other clinical variables on survival. METHODS: The authors conducted an institutional review board-approved chart review to assess patient age at the time of brain metastasis diagnosis, sex, primary disease location, initial radiosurgery date, number of metastases treated, performance status, systemic therapy and ipilimumab history, whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT) use, follow-up duration, and survival at the last follow-up. The Diagnosis-Specific Graded Prognostic Assessment (DSGPA) score was calculated for each patient based on performance status and the number of brain metastases treated. RESULTS: Thirty-five percent of the patients received ipilimumab. The median survival in this group was 21.3 months, as compared with 4.9 months in patients who did not receive ipilimumab. The 2-year survival rate was 47.2% in the ipilimumab group compared with 19.7% in the nonipilimumab group. The DS-GPA score was the most significant predictor of overall survival, and ipilimumab therapy was also independently associated with an improvement in the hazard for death (p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: The survival of patients with melanoma brain metastases managed with ipilimumab and definitive radiosurgery can exceed the commonly anticipated 4-6 months. Using ipilimumab in a supportive treatment paradigm of radiosurgery for brain oligometastases was associated with an increased median survival from 4.9 to 21.3 months, with a 2-year survival rate of 19.7% versus 47.2%. This association between ipilimumab and prolonged survival remains significant even after adjustment for performance status without an increased need for salvage WBRT.	3b
23402397	Phase III randomized study of fotemustine and dacarbazine versus dacarbazine with or without interferon-alpha in advanced malignant melanoma.	BACKGROUND: The effect of the addition of fotemustine and/or interferon (IFN) to standard therapy with dacarbazine alone in patients with advanced malignant melanoma was investigated in a multicenter, randomized 2x2 factorial design trial. METHODS: A total of 260 patients were randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups: (A) fotemustine and dacarbazine repeated on 3-week cycle; (B) same treatment as (A) plus IFN-alpha2b three times per week; (C) dacarbazine alone repeated on 3-week cycle; (D) same treatment as (C) plus IFN-alpha2b three times per week. Two comparisons were planned to assess the efficacy of fotemustine (groups A+B vs. C+D) and IFN-alpha2b (groups A+C vs. B+D). RESULTS: Addition of fotemustine did not significantly improve overall survival (OS) (p=0.28) or progression-free survival (PFS) (p=0.55); Hazard ratio (HR) for OS was 0.93 (95% CI 0.71-1.21). Similarly, addition of IFN-alpha2b did not improve OS (p=0.68) or PFS (p=0.65); HR for OS was 0.92 (95% CI 0.70-1.20). Overall response rate was not improved by the addition of either fotemustine (p=0.87) or IFN-alpha2b (p=0.57). The combination of all three drugs resulted in the highest occurrence of adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: No significant improvement in outcomes were observed with the addition of either fotemustine or IFN-alpha2b to dacarbazine. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01359956.	1b
21708848	Is oral morphine still the first choice opioid for moderate to severe cancer pain? A systematic review within the European Palliative Care Research Collaborative guidelines project.	The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the evidence that oral morphine can be recommended as the first choice opioid in the treatment of moderate to severe cancer pain in updating the European Association for Palliative Care opioid recommendations. A systematic literature review was performed to update the 2007 Cochrane review 'Oral morphine for cancer pain'. The literature search was conducted on MedLine, EMBASE and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases. The search strategy, limited in time (from 1 July 2006 to 31 October 2009), was aimed to be as extensive as possible using both text words and MeSH/EMTREE terms; a hand search of the reference lists of identified papers was also performed. Randomized clinical trials, containing data on efficacy and/or side effects of morphine, were identified. Among the papers retrieved from the cited databases and the Cochrane review, 17 eligible studies, for a total of 2053 patients, and a meta-analysis were selected. These studies do not add significant information to the previous Cochrane review confirming the limitation of efficacy and tolerability data on opioid-naive and non-selected populations of cancer patients treated with morphine and suggesting that oral morphine, oxycodone and hydromorphone have similar efficacy and toxicity in this patient population.	1a
16847528	Outcomes of locally advanced prostate cancer: a single institution study of 209 patients in Japan.	AIM: To investigate the outcomes for Asian populations with locally advanced/clinical stage III prostate cancer (PCa) treated with currently prevailing modalities. METHODS: We reviewed the record of 209 patients with clinical stage III PCa, who were treated at Niigata Cancer Center Hospital between 1992 and 2003. Treatment options included hormone therapy-combined radical prostatectomy (RP+HT), hormone therapy-combined external beam irradiation (EBRT+HT) and primary hormone therapy (PHT). RESULTS: The 5- and 10-year overall survival rates were 80.3% and 46.1% in all cohorts, respectively. The survival rates were 87.3% and 66.5% in the RP+HT group, 94.9% and 70.0% in the EBRT+HT group and 66.1% and 17.2% in the PHT group, respectively. A significant survival advantage was found in the EBRT+HT group compared with that in the PHT group (P < 0.0001). Also, the RP+HT group had better survival than the PHT group (P = 0.0107). The 5- and 10-year disease-specific survival rates for all cases were 92.5% and 80.0%, respectively. They were 93.8% and 71.4% in the RP+HT group, 96.6% and 93.6% in the EBRT+HT group and 88.6% and 62.3% in the PHT group, respectively. A survival advantage was found in the EBRT+HT group compared with the PHT group (P = 0.029). No significant difference was found in disease-specific survival between the EBRT+HT and RP+HT groups or between the RP+HT and PHT groups. CONCLUSION: Although our findings indicate that radiotherapy plus HT has a survival advantage in this stage of PCa, we recommend therapies that take into account the patients'social and medical conditions for Asian men with clinical stage III PCa.	2b
25619686	Three-Arm Randomized Phase III Trial: Quality Aloe and Placebo Cream Versus Powder as Skin Treatment During Breast Cancer Radiation Therapy.	BACKGROUND: The efficacy of aloe extract in reducing radiation-induced skin injury is controversial. The purpose of the present 3-arm randomized trial was to test the efficacy of quality-tested aloe extract in reducing the severity of radiation-induced skin injury and, secondarily, to examine the effect of a moist cream versus a dry powder skin care regimen. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 248 patients with breast cancer were randomized to powder, aloe cream, or placebo cream. Acute skin toxicity was scored weekly and after treatment at weeks 1, 2, and 4 using a modified 10-point Catterall scale. The patients scored their symptom severity using a 6-point Likert scale and kept an acute phase diary. RESULTS: The aloe formulation did not reduce acute skin toxicity or symptom severity. Patients with a greater body mass index were more likely to develop acute skin toxicity. A similar pattern of increased skin reaction toxicity occurred with both study creams compared with the dry powder regimen. CONCLUSION: No evidence was found to support prophylactic application of quality aloe extract or cream to improve the symptoms or reduce the skin reaction severity. Our results support a dry skin care regimen of powder during radiation therapy.	1b
23830782	Cutaneous toxicities of BRAF inhibitors: clinical and pathological challenges and call to action.	"Somatic mutations in the BRAF gene have been identified as the most frequent and relevant to develop targeted molecular therapies in melanoma. Recently, seminal clinical trials have provided indisputable evidence that BRAF inhibitors improve response rate, progression free and overall survival in BRAFV600 mutated metastatic melanoma patients, thus representing the novel standard of care. Dermatological ""off target"" effects of these so-called 'targeted therapies' have to be considered, however, and among them the most intriguing are cutaneous adverse reactions. Skin toxicity is of relevance for at least three reasons: (1) it worsens the patient's quality of life and may be difficult to manage, (2) its heterogeneous clinical presentation differs from the clinico-pathological pictures observed in patients who do not receive BRAF inhibitors, and; (3) onset of skin cancer represents a model of carcinogenesis which may help to better understand the potential visceral tumorigenesis induced by BRAF inhibitors. This manuscript summarizes and critically reviews the state of the art of skin toxicity associated with BRAF inhibitors. Special attention will be paid to clinical presentation and histopathological findings, as well as related challenges for clinicians, pathologists, and basic scientists."	4
18227709	Routine positron emission tomography and positron emission tomography/computed tomography in melanoma staging with positive sentinel node biopsy is of limited benefit.	Positron emission tomography (PET) is increasingly used for the staging and management of melanoma. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of PET or PET/ computed tomography (CT) as a routine procedure in patients with positive sentinel node biopsy (SNB). Thirty patients with melanoma of Breslow thickness greater than 1 mm who had PET or PET/CT scans performed within 100 days after a positive SNB were reviewed retrospectively. Two patients (6%) had a positive PET scan, none of which were melanoma related. The first patient had a synchronous neuroendocrine thyroid tumour and the second patient had increased uptake in the chest wall, which proved to be old trauma. Lymph node dissection was positive in five cases (16%). With a median follow-up of 24 months, 21 patients remained disease free. In none of the 30 cases did the early PET scan after a positive SNB alter subsequent melanoma management. The role of PET scanning soon after a positive sentinel node biopsy seems to be of limited benefit. It is questionable whether any imaging is beneficial at this stage. The results of this review suggest that PET scanning might not be indicated for this group of patients.	3b
20452136	Final results of a prospective study comparing the local control of short-course and long-course radiotherapy for metastatic spinal cord compression.	PURPOSE: Many patients with metastatic spinal cord compression (MSCC) live long enough to develop a recurrence in the irradiated spinal area. This is the first prospective study that has compared local control of different radiotherapy schedules for MSCC. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 265 patients treated with radiotherapy alone were included in this prospective nonrandomized study. The primary goal was to compare local control from short-course (1 x 8 Gy/5 x 4 Gy, n = 131) and long-course radiotherapy (10 x 3 Gy/15 x 2.5 Gy/20 x 2 Gy, n = 134). Secondary end points were motor function and survival. The analysis of local control (no MSCC recurrence in the irradiated spinal area) included the 224 patients with improvement or no change of motor deficits during radiotherapy. Eleven additional factors were evaluated for outcomes. RESULTS: One-year local control was 61% after short-course and 81% after long-course radiotherapy (p = 0.005). On multivariate analysis (MVA), improved local control was associated with long-course radiotherapy (p = 0.018). Motor function improved in 37% after short-course and 39% after long-course radiotherapy (p = 0.95). Improved motor function was associated with better performance status (p = 0.015), favorable tumor type (p = 0.034), and slower development of motor deficits (p < 0.001). One-year survival rates were 23% after short-course and 30% after long-course radiotherapy (p = 0.28). On MVA, improved survival was associated with better performance status (p < 0.001), no visceral metastases (p < 0.001), involvement of only one to three vertebrae (p = 0.040), ambulatory status (p = 0.038), and bisphosphonate administration after radiotherapy (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Long-course radiotherapy was associated with better local control, similar functional outcome, and similar survival compared to short-course radiotherapy. Patients with a relatively favorable expected survival should receive long-course radiotherapy.	2b
19349552	Results of a phase III, randomized, placebo-controlled study of sorafenib in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel as second-line treatment in patients with unresectable stage III or stage IV melanoma.	PURPOSE: This phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of sorafenib with carboplatin and paclitaxel (CP) in patients with advanced melanoma who had progressed on a dacarbazine- or temozolomide-containing regimen. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 270 patients were randomly assigned to receive intravenous paclitaxel 225 mg/m2 plus intravenous carboplatin at area under curve 6 (AUC 6) on day 1 of a 21-day cycle followed by either placebo (n = 135) or oral sorafenib 400 mg (n = 135) twice daily on days 2 to 19. The primary efficacy end point was progression-free survival (PFS); secondary and tertiary end points included overall survival and incidence of best response, respectively. RESULTS: The median PFS was 17.9 weeks for the placebo plus CP arm and 17.4 weeks for the sorafenib plus CP arm (hazard ratio, 0.91; 99% CI, 0.63 to 1.31; two-sided log-rank test P = .49). Response rate was 11% with placebo versus 12% with sorafenib. Dermatologic events, grade 3 thrombocytopenia, diarrhea, and fatigue were more common in patients treated with sorafenib plus CP versus placebo plus CP. CONCLUSION: In this study, the addition of sorafenib to CP did not improve any of the end points over placebo plus CP and cannot be recommended in the second-line setting for patients with advanced melanoma. Both regimens had clinically acceptable toxicity profiles with no unexpected adverse events. A trial of similar design for the first-line treatment of patients with advanced melanoma (intergroup trial E2603) is currently ongoing.	1b
17896141	Impact of total lymph node count and lymph node ratio on staging and survival after pancreatectomy for pancreatic adenocarcinoma: a large, population-based analysis.	BACKGROUND: Based on data from other malignancies, the number of lymph nodes evaluated and the ratio of metastatic to examined lymph nodes (LNR) may be important predictors of survival. LNR has never been investigated in a large population-based study of patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma. METHODS: The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database was used to identify 4005 patients who underwent resection for pancreatic adenocarcinoma from 1988 to 2003. The effect of total lymph node count and LNR on survival was examined using univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: The median number of lymph nodes examined was seven; 390 (10.1%) patients had no lymph nodes examined. Of those patients who had at least one lymph node examined, 1507 (43.3%) had no lymph node metastases (N0) and 1971 (56.7%) had metastatic nodal disease (N1). Overall median survival was 13 months, and 5-year survival was 6.8%. N1 disease was associated with a worse 5-year survival compared with N0 disease (4.3 vs 11.3%, respectively, P < .001). Patients with N0 disease could be further stratified based on the number of lymph nodes evaluated (median survival: 1-11 nodes, 16 months vs 12 or more nodes, 23 months; P < .001). For N1 patients, LNR was one of the most powerful factors associated with survival (LNR > 0-0.2, 15 months; LNR > 0.2-0.4, 12 months; LNR > 0.4, 10 months) (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Most patients have an inadequate number of lymph nodes evaluated following pancreatic surgery. N0 patients who have fewer than 12 lymph nodes examined may be understaged. In patients with N1 disease, LNR may better substratify patients with regard to prognosis.	2b
22995650	Aprepitant for management of severe pruritus related to biological cancer treatments: a pilot study.	BACKGROUND: Itch is a common side-effect of treatment with anti-EGFR antibodies and tyrosine-kinase inhibitors. We designed a pilot single-centre study to assess the effects of aprepitant-a neurokinin receptor inhibitor-for management of severe pruritus induced by biological drugs. METHODS: In this single-group, prospective study, we consecutively enrolled 45 outpatients with metastatic solid tumours treated with biological drugs at the Campus Bio-Medico Hospital of Rome, Rome, Italy, between September, 2010, and November, 2011. We classified patients into two groups: a refactory group, for patients with pruritis refractory to standard treatment, or a naive group, for patients who had not been previously treated for pruritis. Aprepitant (125 mg on day 1; 80 mg on day 3; 80 mg on day 5) was given to patients in the refractory group after at least 1 week of standard systemic treatment. In the naive group, aprepitant was given in the same schedule as the refractory group, after first onset of severe pruritus. Intensity of itch was evaluated by Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) score. The primary endpoint was change in median VAS score. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01683552. FINDINGS: Median VAS in the refractory group was 8.00 (95% CI 7.93-8.57) at baseline and 1.00 (0.00-2.00) after 1 week of treatment with aprepitant (p<0.0001). In the naive group, VAS score was 8.00 (7.43-8.37) at baseline and 0.00 (0.06-1.08) after 1 week of treatment (p<0.0001). 41 (91%) patients responded to aprepitant (ie, had a >50% reduction in intensity of pruritis) and pruritus recurred in only six (13%) patients. No adverse events related to aprepitant occurred. INTERPRETATION: Aprepitant decreases severe pruritus induced by biological treatments; it is an old drug, widely available, and therefore easy to add to the armamentarium of supportive treatment. Although to our knowledge no other studies of the anti-itch activity of aprepitant are planned, the results of our trial warrant confirmation in phase 2 and 3 trials. FUNDING: None.	3b
10801170	Maximum androgen blockade in advanced prostate cancer: an overview of the randomised trials. Prostate Cancer Trialists' Collaborative Group.	BACKGROUND: In advanced prostate cancer, androgen suppression (AS) by surgery or drugs controls testicular hormone secretion, and the further addition of an antiandrogen such as nilutamide, flutamide, or cyproterone acetate is referred to as maximum androgen blockade (MAB). The aim of this overview was to compare the effects on the duration of survival of MAB and of AS alone. METHODS: The collaborative meta-analysis of 27 randomised trials involved central reanalysis of the data on each of 8275 men (98% of those ever randomised in trials of MAB vs AS) with metastatic (88%) or locally advanced (12%) prostate cancer. Half were over 70 years of age, and follow-up was typically for about 5 years. FINDINGS: 5932 (72%) men have died; of the deaths for which causes were provided, about 80% were attributed to prostate cancer. 5-year survival was 25.4% with MAB versus 23.6% with AS alone, a non-significant gain of 1.8% (SE 1.3; logrank 2p=0.11). There was no significant heterogeneity in the treatment effect (MAB vs AS) with respect to age or disease stage. The results for cyproterone acetate, which accounted for only a fifth of the evidence, appeared slightly unfavourable to MAB (5-year survival 15.4% MAB vs 18.1% AS alone; difference -2.8% [SE 2.4]; logrank 2p=0.04 adverse), whereas those for nilutamide and flutamide appeared slightly favourable (5-year survival 27.6% MAB vs 24.7% AS alone; difference 2.9% [SE 1.3]; logrank 2p=0.005). Non-prostate-cancer deaths (although not clearly significantly affected by treatment) accounted for some of the apparently adverse effects of cyproterone acetate. INTERPRETATION: In advanced prostate cancer, addition of an antiandrogen to AS improved the 5-year survival by about 2% or 3% (depending on whether the analysis includes or excludes the cyproterone acetate trials), but the range of uncertainty as to the true size of this benefit runs from about 0% to about 5%.	1a
27136134	Side-effects of checkpoint inhibitor-based combination therapy.	PURPOSE OF REVIEW: After the dramatic and often long-standing response rates of checkpoint inhibitors as single agents, the new era for checkpoint inhibitors is combined therapy (either with other checkpoint inhibitors, chemotherapies, targeted therapies or immunotherapies) that is aiming to do even better. Although one can speculate that these combinations will result in improved results, high cost and potential toxicity are limiting factors for their use. In this review, we plan to report on the different side-effects of the checkpoint inhibitor-based combination therapies and to discuss the future perspectives of these new modalities. RECENT FINDINGS: Many checkpoint inhibitor-based combinations are associated with high response rates (>50%) in melanomas and nonsmall cell lung cancers (NSCLCs). As a result, the combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab for metastatic melanoma was recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration; however, 30% of the patients had to discontinue this combination because of high toxicity. In NSCLC, the combination of chemotherapy and anti-programmed cell death protein 1 or anti-programmed cell death protein ligand 1 agents is leading to high response rate (exceeding 65%) but with more than 40% of the patients presenting grade 3/4 toxicities. Despite the discouraging results with the combination of ipilimumab (anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4) with vemurafenib (anti-proto-oncogene protein B-raf-targeted therapy) due to hepatotoxicity, more recent trials are showing less frequent and severe toxicities with other combinations of checkpoint inhibitors and targeted therapies. SUMMARY: Despite the high toxicity rates observed with some checkpoint inhibitor-based combination therapies, these combinations will likely become the new paradigm for the management of various malignancies, namely, melanomas, renal cell carcinomas and NSCLC, provided that their side-effects can be effectively managed.	3a
24165896	The Indian Spice Turmeric Delays and Mitigates Radiation-Induced Oral Mucositis in Patients Undergoing Treatment for Head and Neck Cancer: An Investigational Study.	PURPOSE: Radiation-induced oral mucositis is an acute morbidity seen in patients undergoing treatment for head and neck cancers. In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of turmeric in preventing radiation-induced mucositis. METHODS: This was a single-blinded, randomized, controlled clinical trial and was conducted with head and neck cancer patients requiring 70 Gy of radiation or chemoradiotherapy (daily radiotherapy plus carboplatin once a week). Eligible patients (n = 80) were randomly assigned to receive either turmeric gargle (n = 40) or povidone-iodine ([n = 40] active comparator condition) during chemo/radiotherapy during the period of treatment. Oral mucositis was assessed using the RTOG (Radiation Therapy Oncology Group) grading system before the start, during, and at the end of the treatment by an investigator unaware of the treatment. The primary endpoint of this study was the incidence of mucositis every week during the 7-week period. The secondary endpoint was the effect of turmeric gargle on the incidence of treatment breaks, loss of scheduled treatment days, and decrease in body weight at the end of the treatment. RESULTS: This study clearly suggests that when compared with the cohorts using povidone-iodine gargle, the group using turmeric as a mouthwash had delayed and reduced the levels of radiation-induced oral mucositis and was statistically significant at all time points (P< 0.001 toP< 0.0001). Additionally, the cohorts using turmeric had decreased intolerable mucositis (P< 0.001) and lesser incidence of treatment breaks in the first half of the treatment schedule before 4 weeks (P< 0.01) and reduced change in body weight (P< 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Gargling with turmeric by head and neck cancer patients undergoing radiation therapy provided significant benefit by delaying and reducing the severity of mucositis. Turmeric is readily available, relatively inexpensive, and highly accepted making it useful in cancer treatment.	1b
10687323	Role of octreotide, scopolamine butylbromide, and hydration in symptom control of patients with inoperable bowel obstruction and nasogastric tubes: a prospective randomized trial.	Bowel obstruction may be an inoperable complication in patients with end-stage cancer. Scopolamine butylbromide (SB) and octreotide (OCT) have been successfully used with the aim of reducing gastrointestinal (GI) secretions to avoid placement of a nasogastric tube (NGT); however, there have been no comparative studies concerning the efficacy of these drugs. Furthermore, there is little information about the role played by parenteral hydration in symptom control of these patients. In a prospective trial that involved all 17 inoperable bowel-obstructed patients presenting to our services with a decompressive NGT, patients were randomized to OCT 0.3 mg/day or SB 60 mg/day for 3 days through a continuous subcutaneous infusion. Clinical data, survival time, and the time interval from the first diagnosis of cancer to the onset of inoperable bowel obstruction were noted. The intensity of pain, nausea, dry mouth, thirst, dyspnea, feeling of abdominal distension, and drowsiness were assessed by means of a verbal scale before starting treatment with the drugs under study (T0) and then daily for 3 days (T1, T2, T3). Moreover, daily information was collected regarding the quantity of GI secretions through the NGT, the oral intake of fluids, the quantity of parenteral hydration, and the analgesic therapy used. The NGT could be removed in all 10 home care and in 3 hospitalized patients without changing the dosage of the drugs. OCT significantly reduced the amount of GI secretions at T2 (P = 0.016) and T3 (P = 0.020). Compared to the home care patients, the hospitalized patients received significantly more parenteral hydration (P = 0.0005) and drank more fluids (P = 0.025). There was no difference in the daily thirst and dry mouth intensity in relation to the amount of parenteral hydration or the treatment provided (OCT or SB). Independent of antisecretory treatment, the patients receiving less parenteral hydration presented significantly more nausea (T0 P = 0.002; T1 P = 0.001; T2 P = 0.003; T3 P = 0.001) and drowsiness at T3 (P < 0.5). Pain relief was obtained in all 17 patients and only two patients required an increase in morphine dose at T1. All patients with inoperable malignant bowel obstruction should undergo treatment with antisecretory drugs so as to evaluate the possibility of removing the NGT. When a more rapid reduction in GI secretions is desired, OCT should be considered as the first choice drug. Parenteral hydration over 500 ml/day may reduce nausea and drowsiness.	3a
25142075	Quality of life of patients with advanced pancreatic cancer during treatment with mistletoe: a randomized controlled trial.	BACKGROUND: The treatment of cancer patients with mistletoe extract is said to prolong their survival and, above all, improve their quality of life. We studied whether the quality of life of patients with advanced pancreatic cancer could be improved by mistletoe extract. METHOD: An open, single-center, group-sequential, randomized phase III trial (ISRCTN70760582) was conducted. From January 2009 to December 2010, 220 patients with locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer who were receiving no further treatment for pancreatic cancer other than best supportive care were included in this trial. They were stratified by prognosis and randomly allocated either to a group that received mistletoe treatment or to one that did not. Mistletoe extract was given in escalating doses by subcutaneous injection three times a week. The planned interim evaluation of data from 220 patients indicated that mistletoe treatment was associated with longer overall survival, and the trial was terminated prematurely. After termination of the study, the results with respect to quality of life (assessed with the QLO-C30 scales of the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer) and trends in body weight were evaluated. RESULTS: Data on quality of life and body weight were obtained from 96 patients treated with mistletoe and 72 control patients. Those treated with mistletoe did better on all 6 functional scales and on 7 of 9 symptom scales, including pain (95% confidence interval [CI] -29 to -17), fatigue (95% CI -36.1 to -25.0), appetite loss (95% CI -51 to -36.7), and insomnia (95% CI -45.8 to -28.6). This is reflected by the trend in body weight during the trial. CONCLUSION: In patients with locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic carcinoma, mistletoe treatment significantly improves the quality of life in comparison to best supportive care alone. Mistletoe is an effective second-line treatment for this disease.	1b
19094450	Pilot Study: effects of parenteral glutamine dipeptide supplementation on neutrophil functions and prevention of chemotherapy-induced side-effects in acute myeloid leukaemia patients.	The effect of parenteral glutamine dipeptide (Gln) supplementation on neutrophil phagocytosis, superoxide anion generation (SAG), prevention of chemotherapy-induced side-effects and cost-effectiveness was examined in a pilot study of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) patients receiving chemotherapy. Sixteen AML patients were randomized to receive intravenous supplementation with Gln (30 g/day) or an equivalent quantity (25 g/day) of a standard amino acid mixture (control) on days 1 - 5 of chemotherapy. Complete blood count was evaluated twice a week until hospital discharge, and neutrophil phagocytosis and SAG were measured when absolute neutrophil count reached > 500 /microl. Patients were observed for development of infection, mucositis and diarrhoea. In Gln-treated patients, the percentage of neutrophil phagocytosis and the SAG levels were significantly higher than in control patients (20.5 +/- 6.0% and 18.9 +/- 2.9 nmol/10(6) neutrophils per 10 min, respectively). The Gln-treated patients lost significantly less weight, tended to have shorter in-patient duration and had less severe oral mucositis than controls. This pilot study provides preliminary indication that parenteral Gln supplementation enhances neutrophil phagocytic function, maintains nutritional status and is cost effective. Parenteral Gln may also prevent oral mucositis, although further studies involving more patients need to be undertaken to confirm this and the other results.	2b
16160131	Comparison of conventional-dose vs high-dose conformal radiation therapy in clinically localized adenocarcinoma of the prostate: a randomized controlled trial.	CONTEXT: Clinically localized prostate cancer is very prevalent among US men, but recurrence after treatment with conventional radiation therapy is common. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the hypothesis that increasing the radiation dose delivered to men with clinically localized prostate cancer improves disease outcome. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Randomized controlled trial of 393 patients with stage T1b through T2b prostate cancer and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels less than 15 ng/mL randomized between January 1996 and December 1999 and treated at 2 US academic institutions. Median age was 67 years and median PSA level was 6.3 ng/mL. Median follow-up was 5.5 (range, 1.2-8.2) years. INTERVENTION: Patients were randomized to receive external beam radiation to a total dose of either 70.2 Gy (conventional dose) or 79.2 Gy (high dose). This was delivered using a combination of conformal photon and proton beams. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Increasing PSA level (ie, biochemical failure) 5 years after treatment. RESULTS: The proportions of men free from biochemical failure at 5 years were 78.8% [corrected] (95% confidence interval, 73.1%-84.6%) [corrected] for conventional-dose and 91.3% [corrected] (95% confidence interval, 87.2%-95.4%) [corrected] for high-dose therapy (P<.001), a 59% [corrected] reduction in the risk of failure. The advantage to high-dose therapy was statistically significant [corrected] in both the low-risk subgroup [corrected] (risk reduction, 84% [P<.001]) [corrected] There has been no significant difference in overall survival rates between the treatment groups. Only 1% of patients receiving conventional-dose and 2% receiving high-dose radiation experienced acute urinary or rectal morbidity of Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) grade 3 or greater. So far, only 2% and 1%, respectively, have experienced late morbidity of RTOG grade 3 or greater. CONCLUSIONS: Men with clinically localized prostate cancer have a lower risk of biochemical failure if they receive high-dose rather than conventional-dose conformal radiation. This advantage was achieved without any associated increase in RTOG grade 3 acute or late urinary or rectal morbidity.	1a
10703904	Efficacy of homeopathic treatment of skin reactions during radiotherapy for breast cancer: a randomised, double-blind clinical trial.	The aim of this study was to assess the effects of Belladonna 7cH and X-ray 15cH associated in the treatment of acute radiodermatitis. A randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial involving 66 patients who had been operated on for breast cancer and were undergoing radiotherapy was conducted. The following parameters were assessed over ten weeks: breast skin colour, warmth, swelling and pigmentation. The efficacy of the treatment was assessed by the comparison of these parameters taken individually and by calculating an Index of Total Severity (sum of the scores of the four parameters) during radiotherapy, and during recovery, 15 and 30 d after the end of the radiotherapy. The differences of the scores of the Index of Total Severity during Radiotherapy were not statistically significant, but showed a trend towards a better activity of the homoeopathic medicine compared to placebo. Analysis of the data on Total Severity during recovery, showed a statistically significant benefit of the active medicines over placebo. The homeopathic medicines had particular effectiveness on the heat of the skin. The limited number of patients observed and the posology employed could have interfered with the significance of the results. Chemotherapy and hormonotherapy do not seem to affect the results.	2b
18512102	Methods of detection of first recurrence in patients with stage I/II primary cutaneous melanoma after sentinel lymph node biopsy.	BACKGROUND: An understanding of the methods of detection of recurrent melanoma after sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is essential for the coordination of a rational plan of follow-up. METHODS: Clinical stage I/II melanoma patients who underwent SLNB from 1991 to 2004 were identified from a prospectively maintained single-institution database. Detection of recurrence by self (awareness of symptoms or abnormal physical findings) or physician (discovered on routine physical or scheduled test) and timing of clinic visit were recorded. Postoperative follow-up included physical exam every 3-4 months for the first year, every 3-6 months for the second year, and every 6-12 months thereafter. Serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and chest X-ray (CXR) were obtained annually. Computed tomography (CT) and positron emission tomography (PET) were performed selectively. RESULTS: Of 1062 patients who underwent SLNB, 203 (19%) experienced 230 initial sites of recurrence; 198 patients were evaluable for follow-up. Median follow-up after first recurrence was 17 months. Symptoms and self-detected physical findings were present in 109 patients (55%); 85 patients (78%) were seen earlier than their scheduled visit. Self-detected physical findings identified in-transit (n = 26; 24%) and nodal (n = 25; 23%) disease. Physician detection occurred in 89 patients (45%), nearly half by a scheduled radiographic test (CXR, 16%; CT, 29%; PET, 1%). The method of detection significantly predicted post-recurrence survival (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: More than half of melanoma recurrences are self-detected; these patients have the most favorable post-recurrence survival rates because of the type of recurrence detected. The mode of detection is a significant predictor of post-recurrence survival. This supports an aggressive program of patient education in self-examination after SLNB for melanoma.	2b
32108029	A Randomized Controlled Trial of a 6-Month Low-Carbohydrate Intervention on Disease Progression in Men with Recurrent Prostate Cancer: Carbohydrate and Prostate Study 2 (CAPS2).	PURPOSE: Both weight loss and low-carbohydrate diets (LCD) without weight loss prolong survival in prostate cancer models. Few human trials have tested weight loss or LCD on prostate cancer. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We conducted a multi-site randomized 6-month trial of LCD versus control on PSA doubling time (PSADT) in patients with prostate cancer with biochemical recurrence (BCR) after local treatment. Eligibility included body mass index (BMI) >/= 24 kg/m(2) and PSADT 3 to 36 months. The LCD arm was instructed to eat [Formula: see text]20 g/carbs/day; the control arm instructed to avoid dietary changes. Primary outcome was PSADT. Secondary outcomes included weight, lipids, glucose metabolism, and diet. RESULTS: Of 60 planned patients, the study stopped early after an interim analysis showed futility. Twenty-seven LCD and 18 control patients completed the study. At 6 months, although both arms consumed similar protein and fats, the LCD arm reduced carbohydrates intake (-117 vs. 8 g, P < 0.001) and lost weight (-12.1 vs. -0.50 kg, P < 0.001). The LCD arm reduced HDL, triglycerides, and HbA1c with no difference in total cholesterol or glucose. Mean PSADT was similar between LCD (21 months) and control (15 months, P = 0.316) arms. In a post hoc exploratory analysis accounting for prestudy PSADT, baseline PSA, primary treatment, and hemoconcentration, PSADT was significantly longer in LCD versus control (28 vs. 13 months, P = 0.021) arms. Adverse events were few, usually mild, and returned to baseline by 6 months. CONCLUSIONS: Among BCR patients, LCD induced weight loss and metabolic benefits with acceptable safety without affecting PSADT, suggesting LCD does not adversely affect prostate cancer growth and is safe. Given exploratory findings of longer PSADT, larger studies testing LCD on disease progression are warranted.	1b
26772891	Rates and predictors of progression to esophageal carcinoma in a large population-based Barrett's esophagus cohort.	BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Rates of progression to esophageal adenocarcinoma in subjects with Barrett's esophagus (BE) are lower than previously estimated. Identification of predictors of progression will enable risk stratification of BE subjects, potentially making current surveillance programs more efficient. We aimed to assess the potential of demographic and lifestyle factors, obesity, and medications in predicting progression in BE. METHODS: BE subjects were identified from the General Practice Research Database using validated diagnostic codes. BE subjects developing esophageal cancer (EC) 12 months after their index BE diagnosis were defined as progressors. Time-to-event analysis was used to assess the overall risk of progression to EC. Cox proportional hazards models and time-varying marginal structural models were used to assess predictors of progression. RESULTS: Included in the analysis were 9660 BE patients. The mean age (SD) of the study subjects was 63 (13.5) years; 62.6% were men. One hundred three subjects (1.1%) progressed to EC. The mean (SD) follow-up since initial diagnosis was 4.8 (3.3) years. The incidence of EC was 2.23 per 1000 person-years of follow-up. Increasing age, male gender, and being overweight (body mass index, 25-29.9) were found to be independent predictors of progression. When time-varying models were used, proton pump inhibitor (PPI) and statin use were protective against progression. CONCLUSIONS: In this large population-based cohort of patients with BE, increasing age, male gender, and being overweight predicted progression to EC, whereas PPI and statin use were protective against EC development. These factors may aid in developing a risk score to predict the risk of progression and chemopreventive strategies in patients with BE.	1b
12394193	Quality of life in patients with malignant melanoma participating in a phase I trial of an autologous tumour-derived vaccine.	Quality of life (QOL) plays an increasingly important role in the decision-making process and the ultimate acceptability of particular treatments for patients. We prospectively examined QOL in patients with advanced melanoma treated with surgery followed by heat-shock protein peptide complex 96 (HSPPC-96) vaccine, an active, patient-specific immunotherapy. QOL (the RAND 36-Item Health Survey; SF-36) and cancer-related intrusive thoughts (Impact of Event Scale; IES) were measured at the start of treatment, 3 weeks later on the final day of treatment, and at follow-up 1 month later in 30 patients with stage III or IV malignant melanoma. Mixed model analyses revealed no significant change over time in the SF-36 Physical or Mental Component Summary scores, or the IES scores. In comparisons with other populations, at the 1 month follow-up assessment, melanoma patients reported similar QOL to patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma who received the same treatment, significantly worse QOL on the physical dimensions and similar QOL on the psychosocial and emotional dimensions compared with the general population, similar QOL to patients with type II diabetes, and significantly better QOL on all three dimensions than patients with congestive heart failure. There was also a significant negative association between IES scores at baseline and mental health scores at each time point ( < 0.002 for all). QOL remained stable during treatment with the HSPPC-96 vaccine. In addition, patients who reported high levels of cancer-related intrusive thoughts at the start of treatment reported worse mental health at the end of the treatment.	4
28411330	A Restorative Yoga Intervention for African-American Breast Cancer Survivors: a Pilot Study.	"BACKGROUND: Data show that yoga is effective for improving health-related outcomes in breast cancer survivors. While breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer among African-American women (AAW), AAW are less likely to engage in yoga compared to other ethnic groups. The goals of the current study were to assess the feasibility of an 8-week restorative yoga program among African-American breast cancer survivors (AA BCS). Specifically, study aims were to (1) measure changes in study outcomes in a restorative yoga (RY) group compared to a wait list control group, (2) assess adherence to the RY program, and (3) assess program satisfaction among study participants. METHODS: Thirty-three AA BCS were randomly assigned to either the RY intervention (n = 18) or wait list control group (n = 15). RY classes met once per week for 8 weeks. Pre- and post-testing assessments were measured at 0 and 8 weeks (immediately post-intervention). RESULTS: Depression scores at follow-up were significantly lower in the yoga group (M = 4.78, SD = 3.56) compared to the control group (M = 6.91, SD = 5.86). No significant group differences were observed for sleep quality, fatigue, or perceived stress. Yoga program participants completing baseline assessments demonstrated 61% adherence to the yoga classes. Average rating of the yoga program was ""very useful."" Recommendations for future yoga programs were provided. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that yoga has a beneficial effect on depression in AA BCS. There is, however, a need to further explore the benefits of yoga among minority breast cancer survivors using a study with larger sample sizes."	2b
19021610	Contrast-enhanced ultrasonography using cadence-contrast pulse sequencing technology for targeted biopsy of the prostate.	OBJECTIVE: To evaluate contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (US) using cadence-contrast pulse sequencing (CPS) technology, compared with systematic biopsy for detecting prostate cancer, as grey-scale US has low sensitivity and specificity for detecting prostate cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In all, 44 men with suspicious prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels and CPS findings were assessed; all had CPS-targeted and systematic biopsy. Transrectal CPS images were taken with a low mechanical index (0.14). A microbubble contrast agent (SonoVue, Bracco International BV, Amsterdam, the Netherlands) was administered as a bolus, with a maximum dose of 4.8 mL. CPS was used to assess prostatic vascularity. Areas with a rapid and increased contrast enhancement within the peripheral zone were defined as suspicious for prostate cancer. Up to five CPS targeted biopsies were taken and subsequently a 10-core systematic biopsy was taken. Cancer detection rates for the two techniques were compared. RESULTS: Overall, cancer was detected in 35 of 44 patients (80%), with a mean PSA level of 3.8 ng/mL. Lesions suspicious on CPS showed cancer in 35 of 44 patients (80%) and systematic biopsy detected cancer in 15 of 44 patients (34%). CPS-targeted cores were positive in 105 of 220 cores (47.7%) and in 41 of 440 systematic biopsy cores (9.3%) (P < 0.001). Lesions suspicious on CPS were false-positive in nine of 44 patients (20%). The mean Gleason score for systematic biopsy was 6.7 and for CPS-targeted biopsy 6.8 (P > 0.05). The sensitivity of CPS for detecting cancer was 100% (confidence interval, 95%). However, limitations in the series included that only CPS-positive cases were investigated, and CPS-targeted biopsy should be evaluated in a more extended biopsy scheme. CONCLUSIONS: Contrast-enhanced US using CPS enables excellent visualization of the microvasculature associated with prostate cancer, and can improve the detection of prostate cancer compared with systematic biopsy.	3a
21468626	Acupuncture improves health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL) and sleep in women with breast cancer and hot flushes.	PURPOSE: Evaluate effects of electro-acupuncture (EA) and hormone therapy (HT) on health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL) and sleep in breast cancer survivors with vasomotor symptoms. METHODS: Forty-five women, randomized to EA (n = 27) for 12 weeks or HT (n = 18) for 24 months, were followed for up to 2 years. Distress caused by, and numbers of, hot flushes, hours slept and times woken up/night, Psychological and General Well-being Index (PGWB) and Women's Health Questionnaire (WHQ) were registered before and during treatment and at 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24 months after start of treatment. RESULTS: After 12 weeks of EA (n = 19), WHQ improved from 0.32 (IQR 0.23-0.53) at baseline to 0.24 (IQR 0.12-0.39; p < 0.001) and PGWB from 78 (IQR 53-89) to 79 (IQR 68-93; p = 0.002). All sleep parameters improved and Hot Flush Score (HFS) decreased by 80%. At 12 months, WHQ, PGWB and all sleep parameters remained significantly improved (n = 14) and HFS decreased by 65%. After 12 weeks of HT (n = 18), WHQ improved from 0.29 (IQR 0.15-0.44) at baseline to 0.15 (IQR 0.05-0.22; p = 0.001), PGWB from 75 (IQR 59-88) to 90 (62-97; p = 0.102) and three of five sleep parameters improved. CONCLUSION: Both EA and HT increased HRQoL and sleep, probably through decreasing numbers of and distress by hot flushes. Although flushes decreased less in the EA group than in the HT group, HRQoL improved at least to the same extent maybe due to other effects of EA, not induced by HT, e.g. on anxiety, vitality and sleep, supported by subscale analyses. EA should be further evaluated as treatment for women with breast cancer and climacteric complaints, since HT no longer can be recommended for these women.	2b
19937477	Does the mechanism of lymph node invasion affect survival in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma?	"BACKGROUND: Lymph node metastases are prognostically significant in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Little is known about the significance of direct lymph node invasion. AIM: The aim of this study is to find out whether direct lymph node invasion has the same prognostic significance as regional nodal metastases. METHODS: Retrospective review of patients resected between 1/1/1993 and 7/31/2008. ""Direct"" was defined as tumor extension into adjacent nodes, and ""regional"" was defined as metastases to peripancreatic nodes. RESULTS: Overall, 517 patients underwent pancreatic resection for adenocarcinoma, of whom 89 had one positive node (direct 26, regional 63), and 79 had two positive nodes (direct 6, regional 68, both 5). Overall, survival of node-negative patients was improved compared to patients with positive nodes (N0 30.8 months vs. N1 16.4 months; p < 0.001). There was no survival difference for patients with direct vs. regional lymph node invasion (p = 0.67). Patients with one positive node had a better overall survival compared to patients with >/=2 positive nodes (22.3 and 15 months, respectively; p < 0.001). The lymph node ratio (+LN/total LN) was prognostically significant after Cox regression (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Isolated direct invasion occurs in 20% of patients with one to two positive nodes. Node involvement by metastasis or by direct invasion are equally significant predictors of reduced survival. Both the number of positive nodes and the lymph node ratio are significant prognostic factors."	2b
15023745	Sentinel lymphonodectomy and s-classification: a successful strategy for better prediction and improvement of outcome of melanoma.	The most successful strategies in the management of melanoma have always been based on early diagnosis and timely surgical removal. Sentinel lymphonodectomy (SLNE) is the most reliable technique for the detection of melanoma micrometastases in regional lymph nodes. The micromorphometric S-classification, a routinely determinable surrogate of tumor burden in the sentinel lymph node (SLN), has high prognostic relevance. SIII metastases, defined by a depth of invasion (d) greater than 1 mm below the capsular level, imply a risk of more than 50% for the presence of nonsentinel lymph node metastases in the same basin and for the emergence of distant metastases within 5 years of follow-up. Corresponding risks with SI metastases (d </= 0.3 mm) and SII metastases (0.3 mm < d </= 1 mm) do not exceed 15%. The survival curve for patients with SIII metastases approaches that of patients in the pre-SLNE era who underwent delayed lymph node dissection for subsequently detected nodal macrometastases. The survival of patients with initially removed SI and SII metastases is much better, similar to that of patients with S0 metastases. This explains the significant survival benefit of SLN-guided surgery in the entire population of patients with melanomas thicker than 0.75 mm, although the outcome of the subgroup without nodal metastases is not influenced by SLNE.	3b
17620286	Role of radiologic imaging at the time of initial diagnosis of stage T1b-T3b melanoma.	BACKGROUND: In patients with T1b-T3b cutaneous melanoma the utility of radiologic imaging at the time of diagnosis is unclear. Whether initial imaging led to a change in stage or treatment plan was investigated. METHODS: The melanoma database was searched for patients with T1b-T3b primary lesions, clinically N0, and asymptomatic for metastatic disease. Radiologic studies conducted before wide local excision +/- sentinel lymph node biopsy as well as all further imaging and investigations were analyzed. Outcome measures included upstaging, change in initial surgical management, true-positive, false-positive, true-negative, and false-negative rates of each imaging modality. RESULTS: In all, 344 preoperative imaging studies (chest x-ray [CXR], computed tomography [CT], positron emission tomography [PET]/CT) were performed on 158 patients, resulting in 49 findings suspicious for metastatic melanoma and 134 findings suggestive of nonmelanoma pathology. Only 1 of 344 (0.3%) studies, a PET/CT, correlated with confirmed metastatic melanoma. The false-positive rates were CXR 5 of 7 (71.4%), chest CT 21 of 24 (87.5%), abdomen/pelvis CT 10 of 11 (90.9%), head CT 2 of 2 (100.0%), PET/CT 3 of 5 (60.0%). No patient was upstaged or had a change in initial surgical management based on preoperative imaging. The cost of all initial imaging and imaging to follow-up abnormal findings was estimated as $555,308 for the 158 patients studied. CONCLUSIONS: Imaging at the time of initial diagnosis of T1b-T3b, clinically N0, M0 melanoma was of low yield with a high false-positive rate, and did not lead to upstaging or change in initial surgical management. These findings suggest that imaging of asymptomatic patients at the time of diagnosis may not be warranted.	3b
27644672	Effect of Ginger and Chamomile on Nausea and Vomiting Caused by Chemotherapy in Iranian Women with Breast Cancer.	BACKGROUND: Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) places a significant burden on the patient. Herbal agents are the most commonly complementary therapies used among the public. This study was done to determine the effect of ginger and chamomile capsules on nausea and vomiting in cases undergoing chemotherapy for breast cancer (BC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a randomized, double-blind and clinical trial study, 65 women with BC undergoing chemotherapy were referred to Breast Cancer Research Center, Tehran, Iran, between May 2013 to June 2014. Regimen for ginger group for 5 days before and 5 days after chemotherapy was: 2 times a day and 500 mg capsules of powdered ginger root in addition to a routine antiemetic regimen consisting of dexamethasone, metoclopramide and aprepitant (DMA) capsules. Chamomile group similarly was: 2 times a day and 500 mg capsules of Matricaria chamomilla extract in addition to a routine antiemetic regimen consisting of DMA capsules. Control group, routine antiemetic regimen consisting of DMA capsules. RESULTS: There were no significant differences between the ginger, chamomile and control groups regarding age. Drugs used for chemotherapy were identical and duration of disease was also matched (1-4 months). Ginger and chamomile were both significantly effective for reducing the frequency of vomiting, there being no significant difference between the ginger and chamomile groups. Moreover, unlike the chamomile, ginger significantly influenced the frequency of nausea. CONCLUSIONS: According to the findings of this study, it should be declared that taking ginger capsules (1 g/day) might relieve CINV safely. Nurses dealing directly with cancer patients should be responsible for providing educational programs for patients and their families about how to deal with their drug regimens and associated side effects.	2b
20350333	A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of high-dose bosentan in patients with stage IV metastatic melanoma receiving first-line dacarbazine chemotherapy.	BACKGROUND: The endothelin system is implicated in the pathogenesis of melanoma. We evaluated the effects of bosentan - a dual endothelin receptor antagonist - in patients receiving first-line dacarbazine therapy for stage IV metastatic cutaneous melanoma in a phase 2, proof-of-concept study. RESULTS: Eligible patients had metastatic cutaneous melanoma naive to chemotherapy or immunotherapy, no central nervous system involvement, and serum lactate dehydrogenase <1.5 x upper limit of normal. Treatment comprised bosentan 500 mg twice daily or matching placebo, in addition to dacarbazine 1000 mg/m2 every three weeks. Eighty patients were randomized (double-blind) and 38 in each group received study treatment. Median time to tumor progression (primary endpoint) was not significantly different between the two groups (placebo, 2.8 months; bosentan, 1.6 months; bosentan/placebo hazard ratio, 1.144; 95% CI, 0.717-1.827; p = 0.5683). Incidences of most adverse events and clinically relevant increases in hepatic transaminases were similar between treatment groups although hemoglobin decrease to >8 and < or = 10 g/dL and < or = 8 g/dL was more common in the bosentan group. CONCLUSIONS: In patients receiving dacarbazine as first-line chemotherapy for metastatic melanoma, the addition of high-dose bosentan had no effect on time to tumor progression or other efficacy parameters. There were no unexpected safety findings. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This study is registered in ClinicalTrials.gov under the unique identifier NCT01009177.	1b
22056637	Ulceration and stage are predictive of interferon efficacy in melanoma: results of the phase III adjuvant trials EORTC 18952 and EORTC 18991.	UNLABELLED: Adjuvant interferon has modest activity in melanoma patients at high risk for relapse. Patient selection is important; stage and ulceration of the primary tumour are key prognostic factors. METHODS: In this post hoc meta-analysis of European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) trials 18952 (intermediate doses of interferon alpha-2b [IFN] versus observation in stage IIb-III patients) and 18991 (pegylated [PEG]-IFN versus observation in stage III patients), the predictive value of ulceration on the efficacy of IFN/PEG-IFN with regard to relapse-free survival (RFS), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS), and overall survival (OS) was assessed in the overall population and in subgroups stratified by stage (IIb and III-N1 [microscopic nodal disease] and III-N2 [macroscopic nodal disease]). FINDINGS: In the overall population, the comparison of IFN/PEG-IFN versus observation for RFS, DMFS and OS yielded estimated hazard ratios (HR) of 0.85 (p = 0.004), 0.89 (p = 0.04) and 0.94 (p = 0.36), respectively. The impact of treatment was greater in the ulceration group (n = 849) compared with the non-ulceration group (n = 1336) for RFS (test for interaction: p = 0.02), DMFS (p < 0.001) and OS (p < 0.001). The greatest risk reductions were observed in patients with ulceration and stage IIb/III-N1, with estimated HR for RFS, DMFS, and OS of 0.69 (p = 0.003), 0.59 (p < 0.0001) and 0.58 (p < 0.0001), respectively. The efficacy of IFN/PEG-IFN was lower in stage III-N2 patients with ulceration and uniformly absent in patients without ulceration. There was consistency between the data of both trials. INTERPRETATION: This meta-analysis of the EORTC 18952 and 18991 trials indicated that both tumour stage and ulceration were predictive factors for the efficacy of adjuvant IFN/PEG-IFN therapy.	1a
24703167	Yoga reduces inflammatory signaling in fatigued breast cancer survivors: a randomized controlled trial.	BACKGROUND: Yoga is a popular mind-body therapy that has demonstrated beneficial effects on psychological, behavioral, and functional outcomes. However, few studies have investigated effects on inflammatory processes. This study tested the hypothesis that an Iyengar yoga intervention specifically designed for fatigued breast cancer survivors would lead to decreases in inflammation-related gene expression and circulating markers of proinflammatory cytokine activity. METHODS: Breast cancer survivors with persistent cancer-related fatigue were randomized to a 12-week Iyengar yoga intervention (n=16) or a 12-week health education control condition (n=15). Blood samples were collected at baseline, post-intervention, and at a 3-month follow-up for genome-wide transcriptional profiling and bioinformatic analyses. Plasma inflammatory markers and salivary cortisol were also assessed. RESULTS: In promoter-based bioinformatics analyses, the yoga group showed reduced activity of the pro-inflammatory transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB), increased activity of the anti-inflammatory glucocorticoid receptor, and reduced activity of cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) family transcription factors relative to controls (all ps<.05). There was also a significant intervention effect on the soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor type II (sTNF-RII), a marker of TNF activity; plasma levels of sTNF-RII remained stable in the yoga group, whereas levels of this marker increased in the health education group (p=.028). A similar, non-significant trend was observed for the interleukin 1 receptor antagonist (p=.16). No significant changes in C reactive protein (CRP), interleukin 6 (IL-6), or diurnal cortisol measures were observed. CONCLUSIONS: A 12-week restorative Iyengar yoga intervention reduced inflammation-related gene expression in breast cancer survivors with persistent fatigue. These findings suggest that a targeted yoga program may have beneficial effects on inflammatory activity in this patient population, with potential relevance for behavioral and physical health.	2b
21263243	Pattern of lymph node involvement and prognosis in pancreatic adenocarcinoma: direct lymph node invasion has similar survival to node-negative disease.	Lymph node status is one of the most important predictors of survival in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Surgically resected pancreatic adenocarcinoma is often locally invasive and may invade directly into peripancreatic lymph nodes. The significance of direct invasion into lymph nodes in the absence of true lymphatic metastases is unclear. The purpose of this study was to retrospectively compare clinical outcome in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma with direct invasion into peripancreatic lymph nodes with patients with node-negative adenocarcinomas and patients with true lymphatic lymph node metastasis. A total of 380 patients with invasive pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma classified as pT3, were evaluated: ductal adenocarcinoma with true lymphatic metastasis to regional lymph nodes (248 cases), ductal adenocarcinoma without lymph node involvement (97 cases), and ductal adenocarcinoma with regional lymph nodes involved only by direct invasion from the main tumor mass (35 cases). Isolated lymph node involvement by direct invasion occurred in 35 of 380 (9%) patients. Overall survival for patients with direct invasion of lymph nodes (median survival, 21 mo; 5-year overall survival, 36%) was not statistically different from patients with node-negative adenocarcinomas (median survival, 30 mo; 5-year overall survival, 31%) (P=0.609). Patients with node-negative adenocarcinomas had an improved survival compared with patients with lymph node involvement by true lymphatic metastasis (median survival, 15 mo; 5-year overall survival, 8%) (P<0.001) regardless of the number of lymph nodes involved by adenocarcinoma. There was a trend toward decreased overall survival for patients with 1 or 2 lymph nodes involved by true lymphatic metastasis compared with patients with direct invasion of tumor into lymph nodes (P=0.056). However, this did not reach statistical significance. Our results indicate that patients with isolated direct lymph node invasion have a comparable overall survival with patients with node-negative adenocarcinomas as opposed to true lymphatic lymph node metastasis.	2b
18499556	Randomized and non-randomized prospective controlled cohort studies in matched pair design for the long-term therapy of corpus uteri cancer patients with a mistletoe preparation (Iscador).	BACKGROUND: Mistletoe preparations such as Iscador are in common use as complementary/anthroposophic medications for many cancer indications, particularly for solid cancers. Efficacy of this complementary therapy is still discussed controversially. OBJECTIVE: Does the long-term therapy with Iscador show any effect on survival or psychosomatic self-regulation of patients with corpus uteri cancer? PATIENTS AND METHODS: Prospective recruitment and long-term follow-up in the following 4 controlled cohort studies. (1) Two randomized matched-pairs studies: corpus uteri cancer patients without (30 pairs) and with distant metastases (26 pairs) that never used any kind of mistletoe therapy were matched for prognostic factors. By pairwise random allocation, one of the patients was suggested mistletoe therapy to be applied by the attending physician. (2) Two non-randomized matched-pairs studies: corpus uteri cancer patients without (103 pairs) and with distant metastases (95 pairs) that already received mistletoe (Iscador) therapy were matched by the same criteria to control patients without Iscador therapy. RESULTS: Concerning overall survival in the randomized studies, a significant effect in favour of Iscador therapy was present only in the first study, the second showed no evidence for an effect: estimate of the hazard ratio and 95% confidence interval: 0.36 (0.16, 0.82) and 1.00 (0.46, 2.16) respectively. In the non-randomized studies, the results that adjusted for relevant prognostic variables were: 0.41 (0.26, 0.63), and 0.61 (0.39, 0.93). The effect of therapy with Iscador within 12 months on psychosomatic self-regulation as a measure of autonomous coping with the disease shows a significant rise in the Iscador group against the control group in the randomized as well as in the non-randomized study on patients with corpus uteri cancer without metastases: estimate of the median difference and 95% confidence interval: 0.40 (0.15, 0.70) and 0.70 (0.25, 1.15) respectively. CONCLUSION: The mistletoe preparation Iscador in these studies has the effect of prolonging overall survival of corpus uteri cancer patients. Psychosomatic self-regulation as a measure of autonomous coping with the disease, rises significantly more under Iscador therapy than under conventional therapy alone.	2b
8053696	Lentigo maligna of the head and neck. Results of treatment by radiotherapy.	BACKGROUND AND DESIGN: Although surgical excision is considered the treatment of choice for lentigo maligna, some elderly patients presenting with large lesions in the head and neck region may not be suitable candidates for surgical management. Radiotherapy has been used for this tumor at the Princess Margaret Hospital, Toronto, Ontario, for over the past 20 years with encouraging results. Fifty-four patients treated between 1968 and 1988 were identified, and their records were reviewed to determine treatment outcome. RESULTS: Younger patients with smaller lesions were treated with surgical excision (n = 18) and achieved an actuarial tumor control rate of 94% at 3 years. Older patients with larger lesions located in the head and neck area were treated by radiotherapy (n = 36), with an actuarial tumor control rate of 86% at 5 years. Three of the four patients not achieving tumor control by radiation were successfully treated with surgical excision, and two of them proved to have malignant melanomas (both Clark's level II) when examined histologically. One patient with residual pigmentation 4 months after treatment was unavailable for follow-up. No patients developed metastatic melanoma. The late cosmetic appearance was acceptable in the majority of irradiated patients, with 11% showing poor cosmesis due to progressive skin pallor, atrophy, and telangiectasia in the treated area. CONCLUSION: Conventional fractionated radiation therapy with superficial x-rays is a simple and effective method of management for lentigo maligna of the head and neck region. It is an excellent alternative treatment to surgical excision, with low morbidity and acceptable long-term cosmetic results.	4
15304151	Natural killer cell activity and quality of life were improved by consumption of a mushroom extract, Agaricus blazei Murill Kyowa, in gynecological cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy.	A mushroom extract, Agaricus blazei Murill Kyowa (ABMK), has been reported to possess antimutagenic and antitumor effects. Here, we investigate the beneficial effects of ABMK consumption on immunological status and qualities of life in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. One hundred cervical, ovarian, and endometrial cancer patients were treated either with carboplatin (300 mg / m(2)) plus VP16 (etoposide, 100 mg / m(2)) or with carboplatin (300 mg / m(2)) plus taxol (175 mg / m(2)) every 3 weeks for at least three cycles with or without oral consumption of ABMK. We observed that natural killer cell activity was significantly higher in ABMK-treated group (ANOVA, n = 39, P < 0.002) as compared with nontreated placebo group (n = 61). However, no significant difference in lymphokine-activated killer and monocyte activities was observed in a manner similar to the count of specific immune cell populations between ABMK-treated and nontreated groups. However, chemotherapy-associated side effects such as appetite, alopecia, emotional stability, and general weakness were all improved by ABMK treatment. Taken together, this suggests that ABMK treatment might be beneficial for gynecological cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy.	2b
8207052	Hyaluronidase as an antidote to extravasation of Vinca alkaloids: clinical results.	Skin necrosis is a recognized potential consequence of an inadvertent extravasation of Vinca alkaloids in the surrounding tissues during i.v. administration. Experimental studies suggest that hyaluronidase, an enzyme that degrades hyaluronic acid and improves the absorption of locally injected drugs, can reduce the risk of progressing to skin necrosis. On this basis, we used this enzyme as a local treatment after extravasations of Vinca alkaloids in seven patients. No patient suffered from subsequent skin necrosis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first clinical report confirming the positive findings of experimental studies on the effectiveness of this antidote.	4
17492334	Significance of common hepatic artery lymph node metastases during pancreaticoduodenectomy for pancreatic head adenocarcinoma.	BACKGROUND: Common hepatic artery lymph nodes (CHALN) are frequently sampled during pancreaticoduodenectomy for adenocarcinomas of the head of the pancreas. In some institutions, if metastatic disease is detected intraoperatively in these lymph nodes, the tumor is considered unresectable and a curative operation is not performed. No solid data exist to support this practice. METHODS: A retrospective review of a prospectively collected database was conducted of the records of all patients who underwent a pancreaticoduodenectomy for pancreatic adenocarcinoma between September 1991 and April 2005. Clinical and pathologic factors were analyzed to determine their influence on survival. RESULTS: Fifty-five of 175 patients had CHALN separately identified and evaluated; these patients constituted the study population. Thirty-eight patients (69%) had one or more lymph nodes with metastatic involvement; 10 of these had disease in CHALN. The median overall survival for patients with node-negative, node-positive (but CHALN-negative), and CHALN-positive disease were 22.9, 16.1, and 14.7 months, respectively. The 5-year overall survival rates for the respective groups were 22%, 17%, and 0%. CONCLUSIONS: CHALN metastases correlate with poor prognosis and no long-term survival. Further studies examining CHALN status are indicated and could lead to modifications of pancreatic cancer staging and management.	2b
24882926	Direct autofluorescence during CO2 laser surgery of the larynx: can it really help the surgeon?	Herein we assessed the impact of direct autofluorescence during intraoperative work-up on obtaining superficial free resection margins, identifying new areas of malignant transformation and altering disease-free survival and local control at 3 years in patients submitted to transoral laser surgery (TLS) for early glottic cancer. Prospective cohort evaluation was carried out on the diagnostic accuracy of the superficial extent and TNM staging in 73 patients with glottic carcinoma undergoing transoral CO2 laser surgery. The use of direct autofluorescence was associated with superficial disease-free margins in 97.2% of cases, and with superficial close margins in 2.8%. The improvement in diagnostic accuracy was 16.4%; in 8.2% of cases, there was upstaging of the TNM classification (in one case, a second neoplastic area in a different laryngeal site was observed and considered to be a second endolaryngeal primary). The sensitivity of direct autofluorescence was 96.5% with a specificity of 98.5%. Overall, 3-year disease-specific survival and local control with laser alone were, respectively: T1a (97.5%, 100%), T1b (86.7%, 86.7%), T2 (88.9%, 88.9%). This study demonstrates that direct autofluorescence can help to identify positive superficial margins, and has a favourable impact on disease-specific survival and local control at 3 years.	4
10960839	Evaluation of prostatic specific antigen and digital rectal examination as screening tests for prostate cancer.	BACKGROUND: The 11,811 first visits and 46,751 annual follow-up visits performed since 1988 were analyzed in order to assess the efficacy of serum prostatic specific antigen (PSA) and digital rectal examination (DRE) for diagnosis of prostate cancer. METHODS: At first visit, screening included DRE and measurement of PSA using 3.0 ng/ml as upper limit of normal, demonstrated as optimal value in the course of the study. Transrectal echography of the prostate (TRUS) was performed only if PSA and/or DRE was abnormal. For elevated PSA, biopsy was performed only if PSA was above the value predicted from prostatic volume measured by TRUS. At follow-up visits, it was decided during the course of the study to use PSA alone. RESULTS: PSA was above 3.0 ng/ml in 16.6% and 15.6% of men at first and follow-up visits, respectively. Prostate cancer was found in 2.9% of men invited for screening at first visit and in only 0.4% of men at follow-up visits for a 7.1-fold decrease at follow-up visits done up to 11 years. PSA alone allowed to find 90.5% and 90. 0% of cancers at first and follow-up visits, respectively, compared to 41.1% and 25.0% by DRE alone. In the presence of normal PSA, 344 and 1,919 DREs are needed to find one prostate cancer at first and follow-up visits, respectively. A significant improvement in stage of the disease is found at follow-up (215 cancers) compared to first visits (337 cancers). Comparison made between men invited for screening and those who were not invited but screened showed no significant difference in terms of incidence and prevalence of prostate cancer as well as diagnosis of cancer as a function of age or as a function of PSA, DRE, and TRUS data. The cost for finding one case of prostate cancer is estimated at Can $2,420 and Can $7, 105 (first and follow-up visits, respectively, when PSA is used as prescreening). CONCLUSIONS: PSA used as prescreening and followed by DRE and TRUS when PSA is abnormal is highly efficient in detecting prostate cancer at a localized (potentially curable) stage since 99% of the cancers diagnosed were at such a localized stage, thus practically eliminating the diagnosis of metastatic and noncurable prostate cancer. The approach used is highly reliable, sensitive, efficient, and acceptable by the general population. The detection of clinically nonsignificant cancer is an exception.	2a
17538165	Gemcitabine plus capecitabine compared with gemcitabine alone in advanced pancreatic cancer: a randomized, multicenter, phase III trial of the Swiss Group for Clinical Cancer Research and the Central European Cooperative Oncology Group.	PURPOSE: This phase III trial compared the efficacy and safety of gemcitabine (Gem) plus capecitabine (GemCap) versus single-agent Gem in advanced/metastatic pancreatic cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned to receive GemCap (oral capecitabine 650 mg/m2 twice daily on days 1 to 14 plus Gem 1,000 mg/m2 by 30-minute infusion on days 1 and 8 every 3 weeks) or Gem (1,000 mg/m2 by 30-minute infusion weekly for 7 weeks, followed by a 1-week break, and then weekly for 3 weeks every 4 weeks). Patients were stratified according to center, Karnofsky performance score (KPS), presence of pain, and disease extent. RESULTS: A total of 319 patients were enrolled between June 2001 and June 2004. Median overall survival (OS) time, the primary end point, was 8.4 and 7.2 months in the GemCap and Gem arms, respectively (P = .234). Post hoc analysis in patients with good KPS (score of 90 to 100) showed a significant prolongation of median OS time in the GemCap arm compared with the Gem arm (10.1 v 7.4 months, respectively; P = .014). The overall frequency of grade 3 or 4 adverse events was similar in each arm. Neutropenia was the most frequent grade 3 or 4 adverse event in both arms. CONCLUSION: GemCap failed to improve OS at a statistically significant level compared with standard Gem treatment. The safety of GemCap and Gem was similar. In the subgroup of patients with good performance status, median OS was improved significantly. GemCap is a practical regimen that may be considered as an alternative to single-agent Gem for the treatment of advanced/metastatic pancreatic cancer patients with a good performance status.	1b
21851220	Coping styles, health status and advance care planning in patients with hematologic malignancies.	This study evaluated whether measures of psychological well-being, including coping style, are associated with advance care planning (ACP). Data were from the Hematology Communications Study (HEMA-COMM), a prospective observational study of physician-patient communication in patients with hematologic malignancies. ACP was defined as having a living will, having a health care proxy, discussing life support with family or friends and discussing life support with a doctor or nurse. A total of 293 patients participated: only 45 (15%) had all the elements of ACP; 215 (73%) had at least one element of ACP, while 33 (11%) did not engage in ACP. In multivariate analysis, specific coping styles but not other measures of psychosocial well-being were associated with having written ACP. Verbal ACP was associated with patient-reported health and physician estimate of life expectancy. Our study suggests that tailoring ACP discussions to a patient's coping style may increase engagement in ACP.	2b
24282659	Systematic review of diagnostic accuracy of reflectance confocal microscopy for melanoma diagnosis in patients with clinically equivocal skin lesions.	BACKGROUND: Melanoma is a cancer of the skin and is increasing in incidence in the UK and Europe. Melanoma is a condition that is often curable if detected at an early stage, which makes accurate diagnosis vital. Reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) is a tool used to image the skin. It gives high magnification images of the skin, which may provide more accurate diagnosis of lesions that are equivocal on clinical examination and dermoscopy. OBJECTIVE: To determine the diagnostic accuracy of reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM), for melanoma diagnosis, as an add-on test to clinical examination and dermoscopy in the diagnosis of equivocal pigmented skin lesions using histopathology as the reference standard. METHODS: A search was conducted of MEDLINE, EMBASE and six other electronic databases from inception to present. Forward citation searching and hand searching of reference lists were also conducted. Diagnostic accuracy studies that assess RCM in the diagnosis of melanoma were included in the review. Two contributors conducted the search, data extraction and assessment of methodological quality using QUADAS-2. Statistical analysis was performed using hierarchical bivariate random effects meta-analysis. RESULTS: 951 titles and abstracts were screened. Five studies comprising 909 lesions were eligible for meta-analysis. Meta-analysis returned a per lesion sensitivity of 93% [95% CI 89-96] and a specificity of 76% [95% CI 68-83]. CONCLUSIONS: The utility of reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) as an add-on test for the diagnosis of melanoma depends on the trade off between over-excising benign lesions and misdiagnosing melanoma as benign. This becomes important when considering lesions on surgically difficult or cosmetically important areas of the body.	2b
22245520	Adjuvant interferon therapy for patients at high risk for recurrent melanoma: an updated systematic review and practice guideline.	After complete resection of melanoma, some patients remain at high risk for recurrence. The efficacy of adjuvant systemic therapy has been inconsistent in randomised trials and remains controversial. An updated systematic review was conducted to identify new evidence on the role of adjuvant interferon therapy in patients with high-risk resected primary melanoma. Outcomes of interest included overall survival, disease-free survival (DFS), adverse effects and quality of life. MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library and the proceedings of the American Society of Clinical Oncology were systematically searched to identify new randomised controlled trials, systematic reviews or meta-analyses. An updated meta-analysis of trials comparing high-dose interferon alpha with observation alone was conducted. The new data are presented in this review. Seven randomised controlled trials met the inclusion criteria: six trials of interferon alone and two trials of interferon plus chemotherapy. Two meta-analyses of adjuvant interferon alpha were also identified. Overall survival was not significantly different between adjuvant high-dose interferon and observation alone (hazard ratio 0.93; 95% confidence interval 0.78-1.12; P = 0.45). A meta-analysis of DFS showed a significant benefit for high-dose interferon over control (hazard ratio 0.77; 95% confidence interval 0.65-0.92; P = 0.004). One trial reported a significant DFS benefit for pegylated interferon over observation alone. Our updated literature review indicates that adjuvant interferon therapy does not confer a significant long-term overall survival benefit in patients with high-risk resected primary melanoma; however, a significant DFS benefit for high-dose interferon or pegylated interferon treatment has been shown. An revised practice guideline was developed based on the systematic review.	1a
21105000	Is the need for an arterial resection a contraindication to pancreatic resection for locally advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma? A case-matched controlled study.	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Arterial resection (AR) has traditionally been considered as a contraindication to pancreatic resection for locally advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma. The objective was to evaluate if pancreatic resection with AR was worthwhile. METHODS: Between January 1990 and December 2008 the records of 26 consecutive patients who underwent a curative-intent pancreatic resection for adenocarcinoma of the pancreas with AR (AR+ group) were matched 1:1 to those of the whole series of pancreatic resection performed in our institution. The final study population (n = 52) included two groups of patients: the study group AR+ = 26 and the control group AR- = 26. RESULTS: The 1- and 3-year survival rates were similar in the two groups (65.9% and 22.1%, median 17 months for the group AR + , versus 50.0% and 17.6%, median 12 months, for the group AR-; P = 0.581). The multivariate analysis showed that: arterial wall invasion at the site of AR, the total number of resected lymph nodes of </=15, and perineural invasion were independent prognostic factors for survival. CONCLUSION: Pancreatic resections with AR for adenocarcinoma allowed to obtain a 3-survival rate similar to that of a matched group of patients not requiring AR.	2b
15014018	A pooled analysis of eastern cooperative oncology group and intergroup trials of adjuvant high-dose interferon for melanoma.	PURPOSE: Nearly 2000 patients with stage IIB and III melanoma have participated in four multicenter, randomized trials, conducted by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group and the Intergroup, investigating adjuvant high-dose IFN-alpha 2b therapy. The objectives of this study were to update the analyses of each individual trial and to analyze prognostic factors and treatment effects based on pooled data. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Survival and disease status were updated to April 2001. Analysis of prognostic factors using optimized statistical models was based on data from patients in E1684, E1690, E1694, and E2696. Analysis of treatment effects versus observation (Obs) was based on data from 713 patients randomized to high-dose IFN-alpha 2b (HDI) or Obs in Trials E1684 and E1690. RESULTS: Updated analysis of E1684, E1690, and E1694 confirmed their original conclusions, now at median follow-up intervals of 2.1-12.6 years. Based on two-sided univariate log-rank analysis of pooled data from E1684 and E1690 (median follow-up, 7.2 years), relapse-free survival (RFS)-but not overall survival (OS)-was significantly prolonged (two-sided log-rank P value = 0.006) for patients treated with HDI versus Obs. Among all patients, prognostic factors that significantly negatively impacted RFS and OS included ulceration, recurrent disease at entry, enrollment in E1684, and age > 49 years. Multivariate statistical models adjusting for these factors confirmed the statistically significant RFS benefit of HDI versus Obs but did not demonstrate a significant OS benefit in the pooled populations. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with high-risk resected melanoma, HDI is effective adjuvant therapy with strong evidence for improved RFS and evidence for moderate improvement in OS based on two prospective randomized studies but not the pooled analysis. Analyses of predictors of relapse and response are now needed to improve the therapeutic value of this modality.	1b
26072362	Effect of time to sentinel-node biopsy on the prognosis of cutaneous melanoma.	INTRODUCTION: In patients with primary cutaneous melanoma, there is generally a delay between excisional biopsy of the primary tumour and sentinel-node biopsy. The objective of this study is to analyse the prognostic implications of this delay. PATIENTS AND METHOD: This was an observational, retrospective, cohort study in four tertiary referral hospitals. A total of 1963 patients were included. The factor of interest was the interval between the date of the excisional biopsy of the primary melanoma and the date of the sentinel-node biopsy (delay time) in the prognosis. The primary outcome was melanoma-specific survival and disease-free survival. RESULTS: A delay time of 40 days or less (hazard ratio (HR), 1.7; confidence interval (CI), 1.2-2.5) increased Breslow thickness (Breslow 2 mm, HR, > 3.7; CI, 1.4-10.7), ulceration (HR, 1.6; CI, 1.1-2.3), sentinel-node metastasis (HR, 2.9; CI, 1.9-4.2), and primary melanoma localised in the head or neck were independently associated with worse melanoma-specific survival (all P < 0.03). The stratified analysis showed that the effect of delay time was at the expense of the patients with a negative sentinel-node biopsy and without regression. CONCLUSION: Early sentinel-node biopsy is associated with worse survival in patients with cutaneous melanoma.	3a
21917447	Comparative study of YKL-40, S-100B and LDH as monitoring tools for Stage IV melanoma.	BACKGROUND: Serum markers can be important tools for the prognostic classification and the treatment monitoring in cancer patients. Recently, the potential new serum marker YKL-40 has been introduced for patients with malignant melanoma. The purpose of this study was to assess the prognostic value of YKL-40 in stage IV melanoma patients regarding treatment outcome and survival compared to the established markers LDH and serum S-100B and to evaluate their ability to discriminate between different stages of the disease. METHODS: YKL-40, LDH and S-100B were measured in serum samples of 50 patients with stage I/II melanoma and 61 patients with metastatic melanoma before and after treatment. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to determine prognostic factors. RESULTS: YKL-40, S-100B and LDH correlated significantly with the stage of disease. In stage IV melanoma patients, only the baseline serum levels of S-100B were significantly associated with treatment response (p=0.031), but not those of LDH (p=0.193) or YKL-40 (p=0.186). We found a strong correlation between treatment response and unchanged or declining S-100B levels over time (p=0.003, OR: 9.52, 95%-CI: 1.87-47.62), but no significant correlation between treatment response and serum changes for LDH (p=0.534) and YKL-40 (p=0.306), respectively. In the Cox Regression analysis, only the serum levels of S-100B proved to have a significant prognostic impact on survival (p<0.0001). CONCLUSION: In melanoma patients, serum levels of YKL-40, S-100B and LDH correlate significantly with the stage of disease. In stage IV melanoma, S100-B significantly correlates with treatment response and survival and is superior to LDH and YKL-40.	2a
20422460	Impact of tumor grade on prognosis in pancreatic cancer: should we include grade in AJCC staging?	BACKGROUND: AJCC staging of pancreatic cancer (PAC) is used to determine prognosis, yet survival within each stage shows wide variation and remains unpredictable. We hypothesized that tumor grade might be responsible for some of this variation and that the addition of grade to current AJCC staging would provide improved prognostication. METHODS: The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database (1991-2005) was used to identify 8082 patients with resected PAC. The impact of grade on overall and stage-specific survival was assessed using Cox regression analysis. Variables in the model were age, sex, tumor size, lymph node status, and tumor grade. RESULTS: For each AJCC stage, survival was significantly worse for high-grade versus low-grade tumors. On multivariate analysis, high tumor grade was an independent predictor of survival for the entire cohort (hazard ratio [HR] 1.40, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.31-1.48) as well as for stage I (HR 1.28, 95% CI 1.07-1.54), stage IIA (HR 1.43, 95% CI 1.26-1.61), stage IIB (HR 1.38, 95% CI 1.27-1.50), stage III (HR 1.28, 95% CI 1.02-1.59), and stage IV (HR 1.58, 95% CI 1.21-2.05) patients. The addition of grade to staging results in a statistically significant survival discrimination between all stages. CONCLUSIONS: Tumor grade is an important prognostic variable of survival in PAC. We propose a novel staging system incorporating grade into current AJCC staging for pancreas cancer. The improved prognostication is more reflective of tumor biology and may impact therapy decisions and stratification of future clinical trials.	2b
2112906	Cost-effectiveness of Veterans Administration hospital-based home care. A randomized clinical trial.	A randomized design was used to examine the cost-effectiveness of a Veterans Administration hospital-based home care program that case managed inpatient and outpatient care. Patients (N = 419) with two or more functional impairments or a terminal illness were randomized to hospital-based home care (n = 211) or customary care (n = 208). Functional status, satisfaction with care, and morale were measured at baseline and at 1 and 6 months after discharge from the hospital; health care utilization was tracked for 6 months. Findings included significantly higher (0.1 on a three-point scale) patient and caregiver satisfaction with care at 1 month and lower Veterans Administration and private sector hospital costs ($3000 vs $4245) for the experimental group. Net per person health care costs were also 13% lower in the experimental group. We conclude that this model of hospital-based home care is cost-effective and that its expansion to cover these two patient groups throughout the Veterans Administration system can improve patient care at no additional cost.	1b
25392906	Excision of fascia in melanoma thicker than 2 mm: no evidence for improved clinical outcome.	BACKGROUND: Lack of evidence-based data causes significant variation among surgeons concerning the depth of wide excision for primary cutaneous melanomas. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the clinical effect of excision of the deep fascia in melanomas thicker than 2 mm on patient outcome. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort review (1996-2012) of patients with melanomas thicker than 2 mm. Included patients underwent excision with a 1-cm margin. Data collected included the patients' sex, age, tumour location, tumour type, Breslow depth and presence of ulceration. Local recurrences, locoregional and distant metastases, and disease-free and overall survival were compared between the fascia-excised and the fascia-preserved groups. RESULTS: Out of 2182 patients with malignant melanomas, 213 melanomas thicker than 2 mm, with a median follow-up of 1547 days, were included. The mean age of the patients was 62.6 years and the mean Breslow depth was 4.2 mm. Analysis of data for death attributable to melanoma (P = 0.72), local recurrence (P = 0.71), and locoregional (P = 0.87) and distant metastases (P = 0.34) were not significantly different between the study groups. Furthermore, Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analysis of both groups showed no evidence of significant difference regarding disease-free [P = 0.35; hazard ratio (HR) 1.25; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.79-1.97] and overall survival (P = 0.63; HR 1.18; 95% CI 0.61-2.27). CONCLUSIONS: We believe that excision of the deep fascia does not improve the outcome of melanomas thicker than 2 mm.	3a
19777195	Prognostic significance of lymph node metastases in pancreatic head cancer treated with extended lymphadenectomy: not just a matter of numbers.	BACKGROUND: The prognostic significance of variables related to nodal involvement (node status, number of disease-positive nodes [posNn], node ratio [Nr], and site of nodal metastases) in patients with resected pancreatic head cancer remains poorly defined. METHODS: Clinical, operative, and pathologic data, including indexes of the burden and extent of nodal involvement, were analyzed in a consecutive series of 77 patients who underwent resection with extended lymphadenectomy for adenocarcinoma of the pancreatic head. RESULTS: Fifty-nine patients (77%) were found to have lymph node (LN) metastases. Median LN count, posNn, and Nr were 28 (10-54), 4 (1-29), and 14% (2%-55%), respectively. Twenty-six patients (44% of N1) had metastases limited to node level (NL) 1 (i.e., peripancreatic nodes); metastases up to NL2 (nodes along main arteries and hepatic hilum) and NL3 (preaortic nodes) were found in 21 (36%) and 12 (20%) patients, respectively. Interestingly, survival of patients with positive LN limited to NL1 was similar to that of node-negative patients (P = 0.407). posNn, Nr, and NL were all significant predictors of survival (P < 0.015). posNn and Nr proved to be an accurate proxy of NL involvement. The best cutoff of posNn was 2 and of and Nr was 10%. CONCLUSIONS: The level of nodal metastatic spread is a statistically significant prognostic factor in cancer of the pancreatic head. Both posNn and Nr are accurate proxy of NL and may improve patients' risk stratification.	2b
18971570	Prednisone adding to usual care treatment for refractory decompensated congestive heart failure.	The aim of the present study was to determine if prednisone, a glucocorticoid, added to conventional treatment for patients with decompensated congestive heart failure (DCHF) refractory to the conventional care, results in significant relief of congestive symptoms and improvement of clinical status. Diuretic-based strategies, as the mainstay in DCHF management, are not always effective in eliciting diuresis. However, the addition of prednisone to standard care may induce potent diuresis in this clinical setting. Thirty-five patients with DCHF were enrolled in the study, and prednisone (1 mg/kg/day with maximum dosage of 60 mg/day) was added to the standard treatment. Primary endpoints were the effects on daily urine volume, patient and physician assessed dyspnea and global clinical status, and changes in renal function. The addition of prednisone induced potent diuresis with time. As a result of the diuresis, congestive symptoms improved markedly in 80% and global clinical status improved markedly in 68.6% of the DCHF patients at the end of the study (P < 0.001). The change in serum creatinine from baseline was -12.21 micromol/L (P < 0.05). Adding prednisone to conventional care in the patients with refractory DCHF induced potent diuresis accompanied by a dramatic relief of congestive symptoms and improvements in clinical status and renal function.	1b
8985019	Combined postoperative radiotherapy and weekly cisplatin infusion for locally advanced head and neck carcinoma: final report of a randomized trial.	PURPOSE: To report the final results of a prospective randomized trial that aimed to evaluate efficacy and toxicity of concomitant postoperative radiotherapy and Cisplatin infusion in patients with Stage III or IV squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck and histological evidence of extracapsular spread of tumor in lymph node metastase(s). METHODS AND MATERIALS: Radiotherapy was delivered using a daily dose of 1.7 Gy for the first 54 Gy and 1.8 to 2 Gy until the completion of the treatment. Cisplatin 50 mg i.v. with forced hydratation was given or not every week (i.e., seven to nine cycles) concurrently with radiotherapy. A total of 44 patients were treated by irradiation only (RT group) and 39 by irradiation with chemotherapy (CM group). RESULTS: The RT group displayed a higher rate of loco-regional failures as compared to CM group (41 vs. 23%; p = 0.08). The overall survival, the survival corrected for deaths by intercurrent disease, and the disease-free survival were better in CM group as compared to RT group with statistically significant differences. Survival without loco-regional treatment failure was better in the CM group, the difference being close to the level of significance (p = 0.05). Survival without distant metastases were comparable in the two therapeutic groups. Ten severe late complications were observed, four in the RT group (17%) and six in the CM group (22%). Cox univariate analysis confirmed the importance of the therapeutic modality in predicting the overall survival, the survival corrected for deaths by intercurrent disease, and the disease-free survival. CONCLUSIONS: The present final report of this phase III study confirms preliminary results. The concomitant use of 50 mg weekly Cisplatin infusion and postoperative radiation improved loco-regional control and survival. No significant increase of late radiation complications was observed in the CM group.	2b
9616458	Evaluation of a hospital-based palliative support service with particular regard to financial outcome measures.	The object of this study was a financial assessment of a hospital-based palliative support service, to be made by comparing the study group with a matched historical control group and a group of contemporary reference patients. The staff consisted of one full-time nurse supported by a surgeon one half-day per week. The patients in the study group utilized fewer institutional days than the control group, according to such parameters as duration of terminal hospitalization (P < 0.05), ratio of days at home to total inclusion days (P < 0.001), and days at home during last two months of life (P < 0.01). These three outcome measures all focus on the most care-intensive last months of life and appeared to be sensitive enough to identify economic advantages of palliative care intervention. The palliative support service defrayed its own costs and in excess of that saved another SK17000 per patient (US$2500).	1b
24519874	The magnitude of the association between smoking and the risk of developing cancer in Brazil: a multicenter study.	OBJECTIVES: To estimate the magnitude of association and identify the aetiological fraction (AF) attributable to smoking in the development of different types of cancers in Brazil. SETTING: We conducted a case-control study, including 231 102 patients registered in the Cancer Hospital Registries (CHR) in the period from 1998 to 2011. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 204 131 cancer cases relating to 30 topographies were compared with 26 971 cases of non-melanoma skin cancer. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Smoking exposure was considered at the time of hospital registration. We calculated OR, unadjusted and adjusted for gender, age and alcohol consumption, with 95% CIs. RESULTS: After adjustment, the risk of developing cancer associated with smoking was very high (piriform sinus, bronchi and lung, larynx, hypopharynx, oropharynx and oral cavity), high (oesophagus and bladder), moderate (anus and anal canal stomach, nasal cavity, middle ear and paranasal sinuses, pancreas, nasopharynx, other parts of the biliary tract and kidney and low (liver, gall)). There was no association between smoking and cancers of the central nervous system and myeloid leukaemia. For thyroid cancer there was a decreased risk of developing the disease. The AF was higher than 50% for hypopharynx, larynx, bronchi and lung, oropharynx, oral cavity and oesophagus cancers. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms a high risk of developing cancer of the hypopharynx, bronchi and lung, larynx, oropharynx and oral cavity, oesophagus and bladder cancer among smokers and establishes the AF attributable to smoking in the development of different types of cancer in Brazil.	3b
24105358	A randomized placebo-controlled pilot study of the impact of healing touch on fatigue in breast cancer patients undergoing radiation therapy.	PURPOSE: This is a pilot study investigating the effect of healing touch (HT) on fatigue in breast cancer patients undergoing radiation therapy (RT). METHODS/DESIGN: This study presents the results of a within-subjects design randomized clinical trial where the treatment group was treated with HT, whereas the control group experienced sham therapy. The setting was a university RT clinic. The participants were breast cancer patients treated with lumpectomy or mastectomy, 21 to 75 years old with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score of 0 to 2. The intervention was a 45-minute session of HT or sham therapy once a week during RT. Outcome measures included fatigue, quality of life (QOL), and anxiety/depression. RESULT: A total of 70 patients were approached, with 41 completing the study. At completion, the HT participants tended to report higher levels of fatigue, statistically significant for interference ( : = .010) and usual fatigue ( : = .024). The control group tended to report greater reductions in fatigue relative to their own means than the HT group (Cohen's : = 0.30 to 0.49 vs 0.06 to 0.18, respectively). There were no statistically significant differences between the groups for QOL. CONCLUSION: Our enrollment and retention indicate that HT is feasible for women during RT. Our pilot findings do not support a beneficial effect of HT on fatigue or QOL. Future research may explore increasing dose and teasing out therapist effect.	1b
25873294	Sleep Quality Improves During Treatment With Bryophyllum pinnatum: An Observational Study on Cancer Patients.	HYPOTHESIS: Cancer patients frequently suffer from poor sleep quality. Bryophyllum pinnatum is a herbal medication used in anthroposophic medicine, which has been shown to be associated with improvements in sleep quality during pregnancy with only few and minor or moderate side-effects reported. In this study, the sleep quality of cancer patients during treatment with B pinnatum was investigated. STUDY DESIGN: In this prospective, observational study, cancer patients suffering from sleep problems were treated with B pinnatum (350 mg tablets, corresponding to 50% of leaf pressed juice [Weleda AG, Arlesheim, Switzerland], dosage at physician's consideration, but most frequently 2 tablets with evening meal and 2 before going to bed). METHODS: Sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index [PSQI]), daily sleepiness (Epworth Sleeping Scale [ESS]), and fatigue (Fatigue Severity Scale [FSS]) were assessed at the beginning of the treatment and after 3 weeks. Possible adverse drug reactions perceived by the patients during the treatment were recorded. From the 28 recruited patients, 20 completed both questionnaires and were considered in the present analysis. Data are expressed as mean +/- standard deviation. RESULTS: Patients were 61 +/- 10.4 years old and the majority were female (17 out of 20). During treatment with B pinnatum, the PSQI decreased from 12.2 +/- 3.62 to 9.1 +/- 3.61 (P < .01), and ESS changed from 8.4 +/- 3.18 to 7.1 +/- 3.98 (P < .05). There was no change in FSS. The treatment was well tolerated by the majority of patients, with only 6 patients reporting discomfort that might have been caused by B pinnatum (fatigue n = 3, dry throat n = 1, agitation n = 1, difficult digestion n = 1). No serious adverse drug reactions were detected. CONCLUSION: B pinnatum may be a suitable treatment for sleep problems of cancer patients. Controlled, randomized clinical trials of the use of B pinnatum in sleep disorders are urgently needed.	4
23573956	TP53 and RPA3 gene variations were associated with risk of glioma in a Chinese Han population.	"Recent advances in human genetic studies have opened new avenues for the identification of susceptibility genes for many complex genetic disorders, especially in the field of rare cancers such as glioma. Glioma is one of the least understood human tumors and the etiology for glioma is barely known. Hundreds of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are found to be related to the risk of glioma in previous studies. This study is committed to investigate the role of heredity in this disorder. To examine and validate how common variants contribute to glioma susceptibility in the Han Chinese population, we evaluated 12 tagging SNPs in a case-control study in the Chinese Han population from Xi'an city of China (301 cases and 302 controls). Overall, two protective alleles and one risk allele for glioma were found by genetic model analyses. In dominant model, the allele ""T"" of rs6947203 in the RPA3 gene acts as a protective allele [odds ratio (OR), 0.59; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.22-0.90; p=0.014]. In recessive model, the allele ""C"" of rs1042522 in the TP53 gene acts as a risk allele (OR, 1.65; 95% CI, 1.05-2.59; p=0.0314). In additive model, the allele ""G"" of rs4140805 in the RPA3 gene (OR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.53-0.99; p=0.0437) and the allele ""T"" of rs6947203 in the RPA3 gene (OR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.42-0.92; p=0.0177) both act as protective alleles. We also observed a haplotype of ""CC"" in the TP53 gene with an increased risk of 34% of developing glioma (p=0.0306).

22126843	The role of paracetamol and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in addition to WHO Step III opioids in the control of pain in advanced cancer. A systematic review of the literature.	BACKGROUND: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and paracetamol are used widely in the management of mild to moderate cancer pain and are frequently combined with opioids in the treatment of moderate to severe pain. AIM: To perform a systematic literature review of the evidence of the efficacy and toxicity of NSAIDs or paracetamol added to WHO Step III opioid treatment for cancer pain. DESIGN AND DATA SOURCES: A systematic literature review of MedLine, EMBASE and Cochrane Central register of controlled trials database was carried out using both text words and MeSH/EMTREE terms. RESULTS: Seven eligible papers were retrieved from the new search and five from the Cochrane review. Five of seven studies showed an additive effect of NSAIDs when combined with opioids either by improving analgesia (three studies) or by reducing the opioid dose (two studies). Paracetamol was only marginally effective in one of five trials. The study designs were not adequate to assess differences in side effects between the opioids alone and opioids in combination with NSAIDs or paracetamol. CONCLUSIONS: The evidence from the available clinical trials is of limited amount and quality, but it weakly supports the proposal that the addition of an NSAIDs to WHO Step III opioids can improve analgesia or reduce opioid dose requirement. There is insufficient evidence to support the use of paracetamol in combination with Step III opioids. Data on the toxicity of NSAIDs in this indication are insufficient owing to the small number of patients and the short duration of treatment reported in the studies.	1a
10623706	Randomized phase III study of temozolomide versus dacarbazine in the treatment of patients with advanced metastatic malignant melanoma.	PURPOSE: To compare, in 305 patients with advanced metastatic melanoma, temozolomide and dacarbazine (DTIC) in terms of overall survival, progression-free survival (PFS), objective response, and safety, and to assess health-related quality of life (QOL) and pharmacokinetics of both drugs and their metabolite, 5-(3-methyltriazen-1-yl)imidazole-4-carboximide (MTIC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were randomized to receive either oral temozolomide at a starting dosage of 200 mg/m(2)/d for 5 days every 28 days or intravenous (IV) DTIC at a starting dosage of 250 mg/m(2)/d for 5 days every 21 days. RESULTS: In the intent-to-treat population, median survival time was 7.7 months for patients treated with temozolomide and 6.4 months for those treated with DTIC (hazards ratio, 1.18; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.92 to 1.52). Median PFS time was significantly longer in the temozolomide-treated group (1.9 months) than in the DTIC-treated group (1.5 months) (P =.012; hazards ratio, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.07 to 1.75). No major difference in drug safety was observed. Temozolomide was well tolerated and produced a noncumulative, transient myelosuppression late in the 28-day cycle. The most common nonhematologic toxicities were mild to moderate nausea and vomiting, which were easily managed. Temozolomide therapy improved health-related QOL; more patients showed improvement or maintenance of physical functioning at week 12. Systemic exposure (area under the curve) to the parent drug and the active metabolite, MTIC, was higher after treatment with oral temozolomide than after IV administration of DTIC. CONCLUSION: Temozolomide demonstrates efficacy equal to that of DTIC and is an oral alternative for patients with advanced metastatic melanoma.	1b
16110751	Epoetin alfa 40000 U once weekly and intravenous iron supply in solid tumor patients: early increase of hemoglobin level during chemotherapy.	The objective of this observational study was the early evaluation of the impact, a week after the first administration of epoetin alfa 40000 U once weekly and i.v. dose of 62.5 mg sodium ferric gluconate for seven days in improving hemoglobin levels in cancer patients affected by mild/moderate or severe anemia during chemotherapy. Twenty patients affected by solid tumors who received epoetin alfa 40000 U once weekly and daily i.v. sodium ferric gluconate for one week were evaluated: 90% of the patients showed hemoglobin increase, with a median level of hemoglobin increase of 0.73 g/L from baseline, and 50% of them showing a hemoglobin increase > 1 gr/L. The treatment was well tolerated and no adverse event was observed. The early increase of hemoglobin level from baseline is interesting and suggestive for the possibility of achieving an adequate hemoglobin level with a short-term treatment. It is still necessary to further explore the real need of iron supplementation to maintain adequate erythropoiesis prior and during epoetin therapy.	4
17084543	Intraoperative radiation therapy for recurrent head-and-neck cancer: the UCSF experience.	PURPOSE: To review a single-institutional experience with the use of intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT) for recurrent head-and-neck cancer. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between 1991 and 2004, 137 patients were treated with gross total resection and IORT for recurrence or persistence of locoregional cancer of the head and neck. One hundred and thirteen patients (83%) had previously received external beam radiation as a component of definitive therapy. Ninety-four patients (69%) had squamous cell histology. Final surgical margins were microscopically positive in 56 patients (41%). IORT was delivered using either a modified linear accelerator or a mobile electron unit and was administered as a single fraction to a median dose of 15 Gy (range, 10-18 Gy). Median follow-up among surviving patients was 41 months (range, 3-122 months). RESULTS: The 1-year, 2-year, and 3-year estimates of in-field control after salvage surgery and IORT were 70%, 64%, and 61%, respectively. Positive margins at the time of IORT predicted for in-field failure (p = 0.001). The 3-year rates of locoregional control, distant metastasis-free survival, and overall survival were 51%, 46%, and 36%, respectively. There were no perioperative fatalities. Complications included wound infection (4 patients), orocutaneous fistula (2 patients), flap necrosis (1 patient), trismus (1 patient), and neuropathy (1 patient). CONCLUSIONS: Intraoperative RT results in effective disease control with acceptable toxicity and should be considered for selected patients with recurrent or persistent cancers of the head and neck.	4
14697421	Impact of neoadjuvant androgen ablation and other factors on late toxicity after external beam prostate radiotherapy.	PURPOSE: To evaluate the late toxicity profile of prostate cancer patients treated with external beam radiotherapy, to investigate the possible risk factors for late toxicity, and to determine whether neoadjuvant androgen ablation (NAA) is a factor. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The study population consisted of 1192 patients with > or =24 months' follow-up. Late GI and GU toxicities were scored with a modified Radiation Therapy Oncology Group/Subjective, Objective, Management, and Analytic scale. All patients were treated with external beam radiotherapy (52.5 Gy in 20 fractions to 72 Gy in 36 fractions), using either conventional or three-dimensional conformal techniques. Of the 1192 patients, 40% received NAA (median 5 months). Risk factors investigated on multivariate analysis were age, past medical history, use of pelvic fields, dose, fractionation, use and duration of neo- and adjuvant androgen ablation, and acute toxicity (Grade 2 or greater). RESULTS: The median follow-up for the group was 49 months (range 24-105). The incidence of late Grade 2-3 GI or GU toxicity was 30% at 5 years (GI 12% and GU 20%). The incidence of late Grade 3 GI or GU toxicity was 8% at 5 years (GI 2.7% and GU 5.5%). No Grade 4 toxicity occurred. The risk factors of significance in relation to the development of late Grade 3 GU toxicity were coexisting GU disease (p = 0.02), prior transurethral resection of the prostate or transurethral resection of bladder tumor (p <0.0001), and presence of acute GU toxicity (p = 0.012). For late Grade 3 GI toxicity, short-term (< or =2 months) NAA (p = 0.0002) and coexisting GI disease (p = 0.017) were risk factors. CONCLUSION: Short-term (< or =2 months) NAA, but not longer durations of NAA, increases the risk of developing Grade 3 GI late toxicity. The possible mechanism of this phenomenon is unclear.	2b
2742488	Evaluation of staging workup in malignant melanoma.	To evaluate the role of staging workup in primary and recurrent malignant melanoma, we reviewed the results in 115 patients with primary melanoma and in 28 patients with recurrent disease who underwent evaluation with chest roentgenograms, radionuclide bone and liver scans, and either a radionuclide brain scan or computed tomography of the brain. Upper gastrointestinal tract series with small-bowel follow-through were obtained in 42 patients. Metastatic disease was documented in nine of 143 chest roentgenograms, seven of 137 liver-spleen scans, three of 141 bone scans, two of 85 brain scans, two of 43 brain computed tomographic scans, and two of 42 upper gastrointestinal tract series. All documented metastasis was in stage II and recurrent melanoma. Postoperatively determined serum lactate dehydrogenase levels showed greater than 300 U/L in all patients with documented metastasis except in two with bone and one with brain metastases. We conclude that, in view of low yield, there is no role for routine metastatic workup to detect silent metastasis in malignant melanoma. Elevated postoperative serum lactate dehydrogenase levels indicate need for metastatic workup.	3b
28968482	Lymphadenectomy for the management of endometrial cancer.	BACKGROUND: This is an update of a previous Cochrane review published in Issue 1, 2010 and updated in Issue 9, 2015. The role of lymphadenectomy in surgical management of endometrial cancer remains controversial. Lymph node metastases can be found in approximately 10% of women who before surgery are thought to have cancer confined to the womb. Removal of all pelvic and para-aortic lymph nodes (lymphadenectomy) at initial surgery has been widely advocated, and pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy remains part of the FIGO (International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics) staging system for endometrial cancer. This recommendation is based on data from studies that suggested improvement in survival following pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy. However, these studies were not randomised controlled trials (RCTs), and treatment of pelvic lymph nodes may not confer a direct therapeutic benefit, other than allocating women to poorer prognosis groups. Furthermore, the Cochrane review and meta-analysis of RCTs of routine adjuvant radiotherapy to treat possible lymph node metastases in women with early-stage endometrial cancer found no survival advantage. Surgical removal of pelvic and para-aortic lymph nodes has serious potential short-term and long-term sequelae. Therefore, it is important to investigate the clinical value of this treatment. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of lymphadenectomy for the management of endometrial cancer. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and Embase to June 2009 for the original review, updated the search to June 2015 for the last updated version and further extended the search to March 2017 for this version of the review. We also searched registers of clinical trials, abstracts of scientific meetings, and reference lists of included studies, and we contacted experts in the field. SELECTION CRITERIA: RCTs and quasi-RCTs that compared lymphadenectomy versus no lymphadenectomy in adult women diagnosed with endometrial cancer. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. Hazard ratios (HRs) for overall and progression-free survival and risk ratios (RRs) comparing adverse events in women who received lymphadenectomy versus those with no lymphadenectomy were pooled in random-effects meta-analyses. We assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach. MAIN RESULTS: 978 unique references were identified via the search strategy. All but 50 were excluded by title and abstract screening. Three RCTs met the inclusion criteria; for one small RCT, data were insufficient for inclusion in the meta-analysis. The two RCTs included in the analysis randomly assigned 1945 women, reported HRs for survival adjusted for prognostic factors and based on 1851 women and had an overall low risk of bias, as they satisfied four of the assessment criteria. The third study had an overall unclear risk of bias, as information provided was not adequate concerning random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, or completeness of outcome reporting.Results of the meta-analysis remained unchanged from the previous versions of this review and indicated no differences in overall and recurrence-free survival between women who underwent lymphadenectomy and those who did not undergo lymphadenectomy (pooled hazard ratio (HR) 1.07, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.81 to 1.43; HR 1.23, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.58 for overall and recurrence-free survival, respectively) (1851 participants, two studies; moderate-quality evidence).We found no difference in risk of direct surgical morbidity between women who underwent lymphadenectomy and those who did not undergo lymphadenectomy. However, women who underwent lymphadenectomy had a significantly higher risk of surgery-related systemic morbidity and lymphoedema/lymphocyst formation than those who did not undergo lymphadenectomy (RR 3.72, 95% CI 1.04 to 13.27; RR 8.39, 95% CI 4.06 to 17.33 for risk of surgery-related systemic morbidity and lymphoedema/lymphocyst formation, respectively) (1922 participants, two studies; high-quality evidence). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: This review found no evidence that lymphadenectomy decreases risk of death or disease recurrence compared with no lymphadenectomy in women with presumed stage I disease. Evidence on serious adverse events suggests that women who undergo lymphadenectomy are more likely to experience surgery-related systemic morbidity or lymphoedema/lymphocyst formation. Currently, no RCT evidence shows the impact of lymphadenectomy in women with higher-stage disease and in those at high risk of disease recurrence.	1a
28501804	Exercise and other non-pharmaceutical interventions for cancer-related fatigue in patients during or after cancer treatment: a systematic review incorporating an indirect-comparisons meta-analysis.	AIM: To assess the relative effects of different types of exercise and other non-pharmaceutical interventions on cancer-related fatigue (CRF) in patients during and after cancer treatment. DESIGN: Systematic review and indirect-comparisons meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES: Articles were searched in PubMed, Cochrane CENTRAL and published meta-analyses. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTING STUDIES: Randomised studies published up to January 2017 evaluating different types of exercise or other non-pharmaceutical interventions to reduce CRF in any cancer type during or after treatment. STUDY APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS: Risk of bias assessment with PEDro criteria and random effects Bayesian network meta-analysis. RESULTS: We included 245 studies. Comparing the treatments with usual care during cancer treatment, relaxation exercise was the highest ranked intervention with a standardisedmean difference (SMD) of -0.77 (95% Credible Interval (CrI) -1.22 to -0.31), while massage (-0.78; -1.55 to -0.01), cognitive-behavioural therapy combined with physical activity (combined CBT, -0.72; -1.34 to -0.09), combined aerobic and resistance training (-0.67; -1.01 to -0.34), resistance training (-0.53; -1.02 to -0.03), aerobic (-0.53; -0.80 to -0.26) and yoga (-0.51; -1.01 to 0.00) all had moderate-to-large SMDs. After cancer treatment, yoga showed the highest effect (-0.68; -0.93 to -0.43). Combined aerobic and resistance training (-0.50; -0.66 to -0.34), combined CBT (-0.45; -0.70 to -0.21), Tai-Chi (-0.45; -0.84 to -0.06), CBT (-0.42; -0.58 to -0.25), resistance training (-0.35; -0.62 to -0.08) and aerobic (-0.33; -0.51 to -0.16) showed all small-to-moderate SMDs. CONCLUSIONS: Patients can choose among different effective types of exercise and non-pharmaceutical interventions to reduce CRF.	1a
22196968	Health-related quality of life in patients with high-risk melanoma randomised in the Nordic phase 3 trial with adjuvant intermediate-dose interferon alfa-2b.	PURPOSE: To compare health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and side-effects in patients with high-risk melanoma participating in a randomised phase III trial of adjuvant interferon alfa-2b (IFN). PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 855 patients with histologically verified resected cutaneous melanoma in AJCC stage IIb (T4 N0 M0) or stage III (Tx N1-3 M0) were randomised to: Arm A: observation only (n = 284); Arm B: 1-year treatment: induction: IFN alfa-2b, 10 MU (flat dose), SC, 5 days/week, 4 weeks, maintenance: IFN alfa-2b, 10 MU (flat dose), SC, 3 days/week for 12 months (n = 285); or Arm C: 2 years of same treatment as Arm B. HRQoL was assessed using The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Core Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) before randomisation and at 8 pre-defined time-points during 2 years. IFN-related side-effects were assessed by a study-specific questionnaire. RESULTS: > 80% of eligible patients returned questionnaires at the different assessment points. Statistically significant interactions between randomisation arm and time after randomisation were found for almost all EORTC QLQ-30 variables. While patients in Arm A improved or remained at baseline levels; patients in Arms B and C reported decreased functioning and quality of life, and an increase in side-effects during their treatment. Patients in Arm B improved after the 12th month assessment, when IFN treatment was scheduled to end, to the 16th month assessment (p < 0.001). The same pattern of improvement was found for 5 of 7 interferon-related side-effects. CONCLUSION: A significant negative impact on HRQoL of IFN treatment was demonstrated, however the impact were reversible when treatment was stopped.	1b
18559026	A systematic review and meta-analysis of the role of positron emission tomography in the follow up of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma following radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy.	OBJECTIVES: This review examines the effectiveness of positron emission tomography (PET) in the detection of recurrent or persistent head and neck squamous cell carcinoma after radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy. DESIGN: A systematic review and meta-analysis of trials of PET for detecting residual/recurrent head and neck squamous cell carcinoma treated by radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy. Trials were quality assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies tool for assessing diagnostic accuracy studies. Quantitative data were extracted and a bivariate random effects model used to calculate pooled sensitivity and specificity. SETTING: Tertiary referral head and neck centre. PARTICIPANTS: Prospective and retrospective studies, excluding reviews, which included patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma who had fluorodeoxyglucose PET in the post-treatment phase following primary treatment by radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy. MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES: Quality assessment, sensitivity, specificity, false positive rates, false negative rates, positive and negative predictive values. RESULTS: Twenty-seven of 1871 identified studies were eligible for inclusion. The pooled sensitivity and specificity of PET for detecting residual or recurrent head and neck squamous cell carcinoma were 94% [95% confidence interval (CI), 87-97%] and 82% (95% CI, 76-86%) respectively. Positive and negative predictive values were 75% (95% CI, 68-82%), and 95% (95% CI, 92-97%) respectively. Sensitivity was greater for scans performed 10 weeks or more after treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Positron emission tomography is highly accurate in this role. However it is less sensitive early after treatment and has poor anatomical detail. PET may reduce the requirement for check endoscopies and planned neck dissections. A protocol for its use in post-treatment surveillance is proposed.	2a
20382075	Five versus six fractions of radiotherapy per week for squamous-cell carcinoma of the head and neck (IAEA-ACC study): a randomised, multicentre trial.	BACKGROUND: Several large randomised studies from western Europe and the USA have shown that accelerated fractionation of radiotherapy might be beneficial in the treatment of squamous-cell carcinoma of the head and neck (HNSCC). The aim of this study--the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) ACC trial--was to determine whether accelerated fractionation could be applied in developing countries, where there are fewer therapeutic resources and where tumour burdens can be heavier. METHODS: Between Jan 6, 1999, to March 31, 2004, nine centres from Asia, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and South America recruited patients with HNSCC of the larynx, pharynx, and oral cavity who were eligible for curative radiotherapy. Patients were randomly assigned in this open-label trial to receive an accelerated regimen of six fractions of radiotherapy per week (n=458) or to receive a conventional radiotherapy regimen of five fractions per week (n=450), receiving a total dose of 66-70 Gy in 33-35 fractions. Patients were stratified by tumour localisation, T classification, histopathological grade, and institution. Randomisation was done by a central computer-generated balanced randomisation algorithm. The primary endpoint was locoregional control, analysed for all eligible patients, irrespective of whether or not they had completed the course of radiotherapy. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00120211. FINDINGS: Six patients in the accelerated group and two in the conventional group were excluded from analyses because of withdrawal of consent or missing data. The planned total radiotherapy dose was received by 418 (92%) of the 452 eligible patients in the accelerated radiotherapy group and 413 (92%) of the 448 patients in the conventional radiotherapy group. Median treatment time was 40 days in the accelerated group and 47 days in the conventional group. The 5-year actuarial rate of locoregional control was 42% in the accelerated group versus 30% in the conventional group (hazard ratio [HR] 0.63, 95% CI 0.49-0.83; p=0.004). Acute morbidity in the form of confluent mucositis was noted in 45 patients in the accelerated group and 22 patients in the conventional group (2.15, 1.27-3.35); severe skin reactions were noted in 87 patients in the accelerated group and 50 patients in the conventional group (1.91, 1.31-2.79). There were no significant differences in late radiation side-effects. INTERPRETATION: An accelerated schedule of radiotherapy for HNSCC was more effective than conventional fractionation, and since it does not require additional resources, might be a suitable new worldwide standard baseline treatment for radiotherapy of HNSCC. FUNDING: International Atomic Energy Agency, Coordinated Research Project (IAEA-CRP E.3.30.18), the Danish Cancer Society, the Danish Strategic Research Council, and the Lundbeck Centre for Interventional Research in Radiation Oncology (CIRRO).	1b
9519951	Immediate or delayed dissection of regional nodes in patients with melanoma of the trunk: a randomised trial. WHO Melanoma Programme.	BACKGROUND: The use of elective regional node dissection in patients with cutaneous melanoma without any clinical evidence of metastatic spread is still debated. Our aim was to evaluate the efficacy of immediate node dissection in patients with melanoma of the trunk and without clinical evidence of regional node and distant metastases. METHODS: An international multicentre randomised trial was carried out by the WHO Melanoma Programme from 1982 to 1989. The trial included only patients with a trunk melanoma 1.5 mm or more in thickness. After wide excision of primary melanoma, patients were randomised to either immediate regional node dissection or a regional node dissection delayed until appearance of regional-node metastases. FINDINGS: Of the 252 patients entered, 240 (95%) were eligible and evaluable for analysis. 122 of these were randomised to immediate node dissection. 5-year survival observed in patients who had delayed node dissection was 51.3% (95% CI 41.7-60.1) compared with 61.7% (52.0-70.1) of patients who had immediate node dissection (p=0.09). 5-year survival rate in patients with occult regional node metastases was 48.2% (28.0-65.8) and 26.6% (13.4-41.8, p=0.04) in patients in whom the regional node dissection was delayed until the time of appearance of regional node metastases. Multivariate analysis showed that routine use of immediate node dissection had no impact on survival (hazard ratio 0.72, 95% CI 0.5-1.02), whilst the status of regional nodes affected survival significantly (p=0.007). The patients with regional nodes that became clinically and histologically positive during follow-up had the poorest prognosis. INTERPRETATION: Node dissection offers increased survival in patients with node metastases only. Sentinel node biopsy may become a tool to identify patients with occult node metastases, who could then undergo node dissection.	3b
14634396	Predictors of treatment after initial surveillance in men with prostate cancer: results from CaPSURE.	PURPOSE: Expectant management of prostate cancer or watchful waiting (WW) is a reasonable option for some men with clinically localized prostate cancer. We identified predictors of eventual prostate cancer treatment in a cohort of men initially choosing WW. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We identified 457 men in the Cancer of the Prostate Strategic Urologic Research Endeavor data base selecting WW as initial management without subsequent treatment for at least 6 months. A subset of these men eventually received active treatment for prostate cancer. These groups were compared with respect to baseline clinical, sociodemographic characteristics and followup prostate specific antigen (PSA) characteristics using Kaplan-Meier life tables and Cox proportional hazards models to determine predictors of active treatment after WW. RESULTS: Of the 457 men initially on WW 188 (41%) went on to active treatment at a median of 1.7 years after diagnosis. Baseline characteristics associated with progression to active treatment included younger age, higher level of formal education, higher PSA and higher Gleason grade. Actuarial freedom from treatment (that is continued WW) was 74% at 2, 63% at 3 and 49% at 5 years with androgen deprivation the most common form of therapy (72%). Men progressing to treatment had higher baseline and followup PSA as well as a significantly greater PSA change that those remaining on WW (7.2 vs -0.4 ng/ml). Other measures of PSA dynamics also predicted eventual active treatment. These observations persisted in multivariate models. CONCLUSIONS: WW is an appropriate and common form of treatment in many men with prostate cancer and about half remain on WW at 5 years. Our analysis of national practice patterns identified demographic, clinical and PSA characteristics associated with men who continue with this modality. Conversely these factors may help determine which men (for example higher risk/PSA) ultimately receive active treatment despite initial treatment preference and allow investigation of the effects of these interventions on cancer outcomes and quality of life.	2a
15718316	Randomized trial comparing iridium implant plus external-beam radiation therapy with external-beam radiation therapy alone in node-negative locally advanced cancer of the prostate.	PURPOSE: To determine if iridium implant (IM) and external-beam radiation therapy (EBRT) is better than standard EBRT in locally advanced prostate cancer. METHODS: Patients with T2 and T3 prostate cancer with no evidence of metastatic disease were randomly assigned to EBRT of 66 Gy in 33 fractions during 6.5 weeks or to IM of 35 Gy delivered to the prostate during 48 hours plus EBRT of 40 Gy in 20 fractions during 4 weeks. The primary outcome consisted of biochemical or clinical failure (BCF). BCF was defined by biochemical failure, clinical failure, or death as a result of prostate cancer. Secondary outcomes included 2-year postradiation biopsy positivity, toxicity, and survival. RESULTS: Between 1992 and 1997, 51 patients were randomly assigned to receive IM plus EBRT, and 53 patients were randomly assigned to receive EBRT alone. The median follow-up was 8.2 years. In the IM plus EBRT arm, 17 patients (29%) experienced BCF compared with 33 patients (61%) in the EBRT arm (hazard ratio, 0.42; P = .0024). Eighty-seven patients (84%) had a postradiation biopsy; 10 (24%) of 42 in the IM plus EBRT arm had biopsy positivity compared with 23 (51%) of 45 in the EBRT arm (odds ratio, 0.30; P = .015). Overall survival was 94% in the IM plus EBRT arm versus 92% in the EBRT arm. CONCLUSION: The combination of IM plus EBRT was superior to EBRT alone for BCF and postradiation biopsy. This trial provides evidence that higher doses of radiation delivered in a shorter duration result in better local as well as biochemical control in locally advanced prostrate cancer.	1a
19826136	Screening for emotional distress in cancer patients: a systematic review of assessment instruments.	Screening for emotional distress is becoming increasingly common in cancer care. This systematic review examines the psychometric properties of the existing tools used to screen patients for emotional distress, with the goal of encouraging screening programs to use standardized tools that have strong psychometrics. Systematic searches of MEDLINE and PsycINFO databases for English-language studies in cancer patients were performed using a uniform set of key words (eg, depression, anxiety, screening, validation, and scale), and the retrieved studies were independently evaluated by two reviewers. Evaluation criteria included the number of validation studies, the number of participants, generalizability, reliability, the quality of the criterion measure, sensitivity, and specificity. The literature search yielded 106 validation studies that described a total of 33 screening measures. Many generic and cancer-specific scales satisfied a fairly high threshold of quality in terms of their psychometric properties and generalizability. Among the ultrashort measures (ie, those containing one to four items), the Combined Depression Questions performed best in patients receiving palliative care. Among the short measures (ie, those containing five to 20 items), the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale demonstrated adequate psychometric properties. Among the long measures (ie, those containing 21-50 items), the Beck Depression Inventory and the General Health Questionaire-28 met all evaluation criteria. The PsychoSocial Screen for Cancer, the Questionnaire on Stress in Cancer Patients-Revised, and the Rotterdam Symptom Checklist are long measures that can also be recommended for routine screening. In addition, other measures may be considered for specific indications or disease types. Some measures, particularly newly developed cancer-specific scales, require further validation against structured clinical interviews (the criterion standard for validation measures) before they can be recommended.	1a
29658430	Adjuvant Pembrolizumab versus Placebo in Resected Stage III Melanoma.	BACKGROUND: The programmed death 1 (PD-1) inhibitor pembrolizumab has been found to prolong progression-free and overall survival among patients with advanced melanoma. We conducted a phase 3 double-blind trial to evaluate pembrolizumab as adjuvant therapy in patients with resected, high-risk stage III melanoma. METHODS: Patients with completely resected stage III melanoma were randomly assigned (with stratification according to cancer stage and geographic region) to receive 200 mg of pembrolizumab (514 patients) or placebo (505 patients) intravenously every 3 weeks for a total of 18 doses (approximately 1 year) or until disease recurrence or unacceptable toxic effects occurred. Recurrence-free survival in the overall intention-to-treat population and in the subgroup of patients with cancer that was positive for the PD-1 ligand (PD-L1) were the primary end points. Safety was also evaluated. RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 15 months, pembrolizumab was associated with significantly longer recurrence-free survival than placebo in the overall intention-to-treat population (1-year rate of recurrence-free survival, 75.4% [95% confidence interval {CI}, 71.3 to 78.9] vs. 61.0% [95% CI, 56.5 to 65.1]; hazard ratio for recurrence or death, 0.57; 98.4% CI, 0.43 to 0.74; P<0.001) and in the subgroup of 853 patients with PD-L1-positive tumors (1-year rate of recurrence-free survival, 77.1% [95% CI, 72.7 to 80.9] in the pembrolizumab group and 62.6% [95% CI, 57.7 to 67.0] in the placebo group; hazard ratio, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.42 to 0.69; P<0.001). Adverse events of grades 3 to 5 that were related to the trial regimen were reported in 14.7% of the patients in the pembrolizumab group and in 3.4% of patients in the placebo group. There was one treatment-related death due to myositis in the pembrolizumab group. CONCLUSIONS: As adjuvant therapy for high-risk stage III melanoma, 200 mg of pembrolizumab administered every 3 weeks for up to 1 year resulted in significantly longer recurrence-free survival than placebo, with no new toxic effects identified.

24521106	Final trial report of sentinel-node biopsy versus nodal observation in melanoma.	BACKGROUND: Sentinel-node biopsy, a minimally invasive procedure for regional melanoma staging, was evaluated in a phase 3 trial. METHODS: We evaluated outcomes in 2001 patients with primary cutaneous melanomas randomly assigned to undergo wide excision and nodal observation, with lymphadenectomy for nodal relapse (observation group), or wide excision and sentinel-node biopsy, with immediate lymphadenectomy for nodal metastases detected on biopsy (biopsy group). Results No significant treatment-related difference in the 10-year melanoma-specific survival rate was seen in the overall study population (20.8% with and 79.2% without nodal metastases). Mean (+/- SE) 10-year disease-free survival rates were significantly improved in the biopsy group, as compared with the observation group, among patients with intermediate-thickness melanomas, defined as 1.20 to 3.50 mm (71.3 +/- 1.8% vs. 64.7 +/- 2.3%; hazard ratio for recurrence or metastasis, 0.76; P=0.01), and those with thick melanomas, defined as >3.50 mm (50.7 +/- 4.0% vs. 40.5 +/- 4.7%; hazard ratio, 0.70; P=0.03). Among patients with intermediate-thickness melanomas, the 10-year melanoma-specific survival rate was 62.1 +/- 4.8% among those with metastasis versus 85.1 +/- 1.5% for those without metastasis (hazard ratio for death from melanoma, 3.09; P<0.001); among patients with thick melanomas, the respective rates were 48.0 +/- 7.0% and 64.6 +/- 4.9% (hazard ratio, 1.75; P=0.03). Biopsy-based management improved the 10-year rate of distant disease-free survival (hazard ratio for distant metastasis, 0.62; P=0.02) and the 10-year rate of melanoma-specific survival (hazard ratio for death from melanoma, 0.56; P=0.006) for patients with intermediate-thickness melanomas and nodal metastases. Accelerated-failure-time latent-subgroup analysis was performed to account for the fact that nodal status was initially known only in the biopsy group, and a significant treatment benefit persisted. CONCLUSIONS: Biopsy-based staging of intermediate-thickness or thick primary melanomas provides important prognostic information and identifies patients with nodal metastases who may benefit from immediate complete lymphadenectomy. Biopsy-based management prolongs disease-free survival for all patients and prolongs distant disease-free survival and melanoma-specific survival for patients with nodal metastases from intermediate-thickness melanomas.

19467811	Transarterial chemoembolization of liver metastases in patients with uveal melanoma.	Metastases from uveal melanoma are often confined to the liver. Palliative hepatic chemoembolization has been considered to be a reasonable treatment approach. We enrolled 14 patients with hepatic metastases from uveal melanoma into a pilot trial of transarterial chemoembolization (TACE). All patients received additional systemic immuno-chemotherapy or best supportive care. In 31 procedures 100mg/m(2) of cisplatine was continuously infused by means of a power injector preceding embolization by manual injection of polyvinyl alcohol particles. In three procedures cisplatine was replaced by 200mg/m(2) carboplatine because of increased serum creatinine levels. Tumor response was evaluated using RECIST criteria. Fourteen patients received 34 TACE's (mean: 2.4 treatments). Eight patients (57%) achieved partial response (PR), four patients (29%) had stable disease and two patients (14%) tumor progression. Median time to progression was 8.5 months (5-35 months). Median survival after first TACE was 14.5 months in responders compared to 10 months in non-responders (p=0.18, not significant) and 11.5 months (3-69 months) in all patients. In seven patients with metastases occupying less than 25% of liver volume median survival was 17 months compared to 11 months in seven patients with tumor involvement of more than 25% (p=0.02) with partial response rate of 86% and 29%, respectively. TACE of liver metastases from uveal melanoma is well tolerated and may prolong survival in patients with limited tumor extension.	4
21708857	Conversion ratios for opioid switching in the treatment of cancer pain: a systematic review.	In this paper we describe the results of a systematic search of the literature on conversion ratios during opioid switching. This is part of a project of the European Palliative Care Research Collaboration to update the European Association for Palliative Care recommendations for the use of opioid analgesics in the treatment of cancer pain. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they involved adult patients with chronic cancer pain, contained data on opioid conversion ratios, were prospective and were written in English. Thirty-one studies were identified and included. The majority of the studies had methodological flaws and were not designed to explore or demonstrate equianalgesic dose data. However, the data allow some recommendations to be made that could be helpful to clinicians for whom there are few reliable experimental data on which to base dosing guidelines. Switching to transdermal fentanyl (TDfe) or buprenorphine (TDbu) is an option for patients with stable, controlled pain. Reliable and consistent studies show a ratio of 100 : 1 between oral morphine (ORmo) and TDfe. A ratio of 75 : 1 between ORmo and TDbu may be appropriate, but the supporting evidence here is much less robust. Data are relatively consistent to support a conversion ratio between ORmo and oral hydromorphone (ORhy) of 5 : 1. Despite some limitations, there is evidence to support the use of an approximate conversion ratio of ORmo:oral oxycodone (ORox) of 1.5 : 1. The conversion between ORox and ORhy is estimated to be 1 : 4. When switching from different opioids to methadone the conversion ratio is highly variable, ranging from 5 : 1 to 10 : 1 and much higher in some studies. The derived ratios are influenced by several factors, including the reasons for switching and previous opioid doses. An individual treatment decision and strict monitoring is recommended for patients considered at risk.	1a
23392854	Stage IV melanoma: completely resectable patients are scarce.	BACKGROUND: In melanoma, about 1 in 5 patients develops distant metastases and suffers a very poor prognosis. Common treatment options comprise surgery, systemic medical therapy, and radiotherapy, depending on the number, the location, and the resectability of distant metastases. Previous studies suggested that surgery should be the first choice of treatment whenever complete surgical removal is feasible. However, the proportion of patients that are candidates for this approach is not clear. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the extent of disease and resectability in melanoma patients presenting with stage IV disease at our institute. METHODS: All melanoma patients diagnosed with stage IV between January 2011 and August 2012 were assessed for extent and resectability of their disease. RESULTS: About half of 70 assessed patients had 7 or more metastases at diagnosis, whereas 13 patients had only 1 metastasis. The vast majority (n = 55, 78.6 %) was ineligible for complete surgical resection. Six patients did receive complete surgery as initial stage IV treatment and in 9 patients incomplete surgery was performed. Widespread disease (n = 44) and unresectable metastasis (n = 11) were the most common reasons for refraining from complete surgery. CONCLUSION: The results of the present study show that only a small proportion of patients diagnosed with stage IV melanoma are candidates for complete surgical resection with curative intent in our institution.	3a
18646110	Oxygen therapy for dyspnoea in adults.	BACKGROUND: Dyspnoea, or distressing breathing, is often a severe subjective symptom in terminal illness and may be difficult to control. Oxygen therapy is currently one of the interventions used to treat it. This review aimed to identify all randomised controlled studies (RCTs) in which oxygen therapy was used as a treatment to relieve dyspnoea in chronic terminal illness, and to synthesize the findings into a conclusion regarding the overall effectiveness of oxygen therapy for the palliation of dyspnoea in chronic terminal illness. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this review was to determine if oxygen therapy, administered in a non-acute care setting, provided additional relief of dyspnoea in study participants with chronic end-stage disease over that provided by breathing room air or placebo air as a control. SEARCH STRATEGY: Electronic databases were searched using predefined search terms. Searches were current to April 2006. SELECTION CRITERIA: Only RCTs were considered for inclusion in this review. Unblinded studies were included. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data was extracted by one review author and checked by another. MAIN RESULTS: Eight studies met the inclusion criteria for the review and included a total of 144 participants (cancer; n = 97, cardiac failure; n = 35, kyphoscoliosis; n = 12). Four cross-over studies, two studies with the participants at rest and two involving exercise testing, compared oxygen inhalation to air inhalation for dyspnoea management in adults with advanced cancer. Three cross-over studies compared the use of oxygen inhalation to air inhalation in adults with stable chronic heart failure for dyspnoea management during exercise testing and one crossover study compared ambulatory oxygen therapy with air inhalation on exercise-induced dyspnoea for study participants with kyphoscoliosis (a sideways and forwards curvature of the spine). No studies with matched or cohort controls were identified. Due to differences in study designs, few studies could be pooled for a meta-analysis. This systematic review of the literature failed to demonstrate a consistent beneficial effect of oxygen inhalation over air inhalation for study participants with dyspnoea due to end-stage cancer or cardiac failure. Some cancer study participants appeared to feel better during oxygen inhalation. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The failure to demonstrate a beneficial effect for oxygen breathing over air breathing in cancer or cardiac failure was limited by the small volume of research studies available for inclusion, the small numbers of participants and by the methods used in the studies.	1a
1777617	[Disorders of oxidizing metabolism as a criterion of evaluation of the course of wound healing in experimental animals].	The authors carried out 90 experiments in fertile male Wistar rats and 10 experiments in rabbits with noncomplicated and complicated (infectious) wounds. We have revealed in the first 24 hours the characteristic changes of pro- and antioxidation potentials and acid-alkaline condition of blood plasma. The increasing of specific activity of LPO product by 30-40% and the decreasing of hydroperoxides level in comparison with the initial levels of these indicators and the decreasing of blood pH point out the possibility of purulent inflammation development in postoperative wounds. We can use the special treatment of purulent inflammatory wounds in early stages of its development by the meaning of prognostication of wound healing that is very valuable in medical practice.	2b
19388866	Effectiveness of guarana (Paullinia cupana) for postradiation fatigue and depression: results of a pilot double-blind randomized study.	CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVE: Guarana (Paullinia cupana) has been used medicinally for centuries. The aim of this study is evaluate the effectiveness of guarana in the treatment of postradiation depression and fatigue. DESIGN AND SETTING: This study had a double-blind randomized design with crossover between experimental arms, at Faculdade de Medicina da Fundacao do ABC. METHODS: We conducted a randomized double-blind crossover trial with 36 patients with breast cancer undergoing adjuvant radiation therapy. We randomized patients to either guarana 75 mg daily p.o. or to placebo. Patients were switched to the other experimental arm at the middle of the radiation treatment, which consisted of 28 daily fractions of 180 cGy. Evaluations were conducted at the beginning, at the middle, and at the end of radiation therapy. RESULTS: We were unable to show any statistically significant differences between the guarana and the placebo-treated group with any of the measured scores. Also, within the same group, we did not see any statistically significant associations during either the guarana- or placebo-treated periods with any of the aforementioned measures. CONCLUSIONS: We were unable to show that patients with breast cancer undergoing radiation therapy derive any advantage with guarana over placebo for both fatigue and depressive symptoms.	2b
31855257	Clinical Evidence for Association of Acupuncture and Acupressure With Improved Cancer Pain: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.	Importance: Research into acupuncture and acupressure and their application for cancer pain has been growing, but the findings have been inconsistent. Objective: To evaluate the existing randomized clinical trials (RCTs) for evidence of the association of acupuncture and acupressure with reduction in cancer pain. Data Sources: Three English-language databases (PubMed, Embase, and CINAHL) and 4 Chinese-language biomedical databases (Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, VIP Database for Chinese Technical Periodicals, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and Wanfang) were searched for RCTs published from database inception through March 31, 2019. Study Selection: Randomized clinical trials that compared acupuncture and acupressure with a sham control, analgesic therapy, or usual care for managing cancer pain were included. Data Extraction and Synthesis: Data were screened and extracted independently using predesigned forms. The quality of RCTs was appraised with the Cochrane Collaboration risk of bias tool. Random-effects modeling was used to calculate the effect sizes of included RCTs. The quality of evidence was evaluated with the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was pain intensity measured by the Brief Pain Inventory, Numerical Rating Scale, Visual Analog Scale, or Verbal Rating Scale. Results: A total of 17 RCTs (with 1111 patients) were included in the systematic review, and data from 14 RCTs (with 920 patients) were used in the meta-analysis. Seven sham-controlled RCTs (35%) were notable for their high quality, being judged to have a low risk of bias for all of their domains, and showed that real (compared with sham) acupuncture was associated with reduced pain intensity (mean difference [MD], -1.38 points; 95% CI, -2.13 to -0.64 points; I2 = 81%). A favorable association was also seen when acupuncture and acupressure were combined with analgesic therapy in 6 RCTs for reducing pain intensity (MD, -1.44 points; 95% CI, -1.98 to -0.89; I2 = 92%) and in 2 RCTs for reducing opioid dose (MD, -30.00 mg morphine equivalent daily dose; 95% CI, -37.5 mg to -22.5 mg). The evidence grade was moderate because of the substantial heterogeneity among studies. Conclusions and Relevance: This systematic review and meta-analysis found that acupuncture and/or acupressure was significantly associated with reduced cancer pain and decreased use of analgesics, although the evidence level was moderate. This finding suggests that more rigorous trials are needed to identify the association of acupuncture and acupressure with specific types of cancer pain and to integrate such evidence into clinical care to reduce opioid use.	1a
3959688	[Anaerobic infections in ulcerating tumors of the head and neck. A contribution to the problem of odors].	Incurable exulcerated head and neck tumours frequently produce a foul odour which is a great problem for patients, nurses and family of patients. This odour is a sign of anaerobic infection in necrotic tumours. Bacteriological examinations in fifteen patients with tumours of the oral cavity, the oropharynx and with recurrent tumours of the hypopharynx and larynx showed anaerobic bacteria. Bacteroides melaninogenicus, B. oralis, B. bivius, Peptococcus and Fusobacterium were most frequently represented. Five cases showed mixed aerobic-anaerobic infections. Foul odour disappeared regularly after a short time by antianaerobic chemotherapy (clindamycin or metronidazole). Foetor is evidently caused by microbial activity of anaerobic bacteria in secondary infected tumours. Antibiotic treatment directed strictly against anaerobes helps to improve quality of life of patients with advanced head and neck cancer with regard to foetor.	3a
28715540	Predictors of Hand-Foot Syndrome and Pyridoxine for Prevention of Capecitabine-Induced Hand-Foot Syndrome: A Randomized Clinical Trial.	IMPORTANCE: Hand-foot syndrome (HFS) is a common adverse effect of capecitabine treatment. OBJECTIVE: To compare the incidence and time to onset of grade 2 or greater HFS in patients receiving pyridoxine vs placebo and to identify biomarkers predictive of HFS. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This single-center, randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial conducted at National Cancer Centre Singapore assessed whether oral pyridoxine could prevent the onset of grade 2 or higher HFS in 210 patients scheduled to receive single-agent capecitabine chemotherapy for breast, colorectal, and other cancers. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomized to receive concurrent pyridoxine (200 mg) or placebo daily for a maximum of 8 cycles of capecitabine, with stratification by sex and use in adjuvant or neoadjuvant vs palliative setting. Patients were withdrawn from the study on development of grade 2 or higher HFS or cessation of capecitabine. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary end point was the incidence of grade 2 or higher HFS in patients receiving pyridoxine. Secondary end points included the time to onset (days) of grade 2 or higher HFS and identification of biomarkers predictive of HFS, including baseline folate and vitamin B12 levels, as well as genetic polymorphisms with genome-wide arrays. RESULTS: In this cohort of 210 patients (median [range] age, 58 [26-82] years; 162 women) grade 2 or higher HFS occurred in 33 patients (31.4%) in the pyridoxine arm vs 39 patients (37.1%) in the placebo arm (P = .38). The median time to onset of grade 2 or higher HFS was not reached in both arms. In univariate analysis, the starting dose of capecitabine (odds ratio [OR], 1.99; 95% CI, 1.32-3.00; P = .001), serum folate levels (OR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.10-1.47; P = .001), and red blood cell folate levels (OR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.08-1.44; P = .003) were associated with increased risk of grade 2 or higher HFS. In multivariate analyses, serum folate (OR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.12-1.52; P < .001) and red blood cell folate (OR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.10-1.49; P = .001) were the only significant predictors of grade 2 or higher HFS. Grade 2 or higher HFS was associated with 300 DNA variants at genome-wide significance (P < 5 x 10-8), including a novel DPYD variant (rs75267292; P = 1.57 x 10-10), and variants in the MACF1 (rs183324967, P = 4.80 x 10-11; rs148221738, P = 5.73 x 10-10) and SPRY2 (rs117876855, P < 1.01 x 10-8; rs139544515, P = 1.30 x 10-8) genes involved in wound healing. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Pyridoxine did not significantly prevent or delay the onset of grade 2 or higher HFS. Serum and red blood cell folate levels are independent predictors of HFS.

12756090	The status of high-intensity focused ultrasound in the treatment of localized prostate cancer and the impact of a combined resection.	To decrease side effects observed after high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) treatment for localized prostate cancer and to re-establish normal micturition in a patient population that often presents with concomitant prostate enlargement, the impact of a combined transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) and HIFU has been evaluated. TURP and HIFU treatments were performed under the same spinal anesthesia. For the HIFU treatments, the Ablatherm device (EDAP SA, Lyon, France) was used. Selection criteria for HIFU treatment were localized prostate cancer, no previous treatment for prostate cancer, and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) pound 15 ng/mL at diagnosis. All patients meeting these criteria were considered for treatment and analysis. PSA nadir and stability, histology, International Prostate Specific Score (IPSS) and IPSS-quality of life, and morbidity were assessed during follow-up; 271 patients were selected: 96 in the HIFU group and 175 in the TURP plus HIFU group. A statistically significant impact was observed on catheter time (40.0 days versus 7.0 in median), incontinence (15.4% versus 6.9%), urinary infection (47.9% versus 11.4%), and the evolution of the post-treatment IPSS (8.91 versus 3.37 in average) in favor of the TURP plus HIFU group. No significant changes were observed regarding efficacy during short-term follow-up when considering a 25% retreatment rate in the HIFU group versus a 4% retreatment rate in the TURP plus HIFU group. The combination of a TURP and HIFU treatment reduces the treatment-related morbidity significantly. The patient management after a combined TURP and HIFU treatment is comparable with the management after a single TURP.	3a
